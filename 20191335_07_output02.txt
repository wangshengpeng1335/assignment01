[0482] be (132) 
[0483] more (421) 
[0484] disturbing (90) 
[0485] than (69)

[0543] rise (335) 
[0544] up (181) 
[0545] around (932) 
[0546] the (235) 
[0547] man (565) 
[0548] who (694) 
[0549] first (170) 
[0550] finds (872) 
[0551] himself (168) 
[0552] master (622) 
[0553] of (133) 
[0554] his (470) 
[0555] own (88) 
[0556] establishment, (175) 
[0557] were (568) 
[0558] sufficient (48) 
[0559] to (185) 
[0560] absorb (166) 
[0561] all (187) 
[0562] my (422) 
[0563] attention, (260) 
[0564] while (327) 
[0565] Holmes, (600) 
[0566] who (91) 
[0567] loathed (932) 
[0568] every (10) 
[0569] form (684) 
[0570] of (349) 
[0571] society (955) 
[0572] with (785) 
[0573] his (460) 
[0574] whole (775) 
[0575] Bohemian (185) 
[0576] soul, (794) 
[0577] remained (580) 
[0578] in (569) 
[0579] our (392) 
[0580] lodgings (109) 
[0581] in (959) 
[0582] Baker (634) 
[0583] Street, (38) 
[0584] buried (898) 
[0585] among (746) 
[0586] his (533) 
[0587] old (655) 
[0588] books, (369) 
[0589] and (620) 
[0590] alternating (340) 
[0591] from (322) 
[0592] week (692) 
[0593] to (642) 
[0594] week (902) 
[0595] between (896) 
[0596] cocaine (52) 
[0597] and (605) 
[0598] ambition, (180) 
[0599] the (705) 
[0600] drowsiness (910) 
[0601] of (858) 
[0602] the (0) 
[0603] drug, (344) 
[0604] and (169) 
[0605] the (888) 
[0606] fierce (18) 
[0607] energy (325) 
[0608] of (373) 
[0609] his (613) 
[0610] own (305) 
[0611] keen (395) 
[0612] nature (186) 
[0613] He (79) 
[0614] was (810) 
[0615] still, (174) 
[0616] as (318) 
[0617] ever, (64) 
[0618] deeply (315) 
[0619] attracted (236) 
[0620] by (542) 
[0621] the (206) 
[0622] study (933) 
[0623] of (427) 
[0624] crime, (884) 
[0625] and (614) 
[0626] occupied (555) 
[0627] his (320) 
[0628] immense (102) 
[0629] faculties (460) 
[0630] and (943) 
[0631] extraordinary (746) 
[0632] powers (890) 
[0633] of (736) 
[0634] observation (456) 
[0635] in (425) 
[0636] following (300) 
[0637] out (220) 
[0638] those (520) 
[0639] clues, (402) 
[0640] and (178) 
[0641] clearing (34) 
[0642] up (525) 
[0643] those (585) 
[0644] mysteries (355) 
[0645] which (828) 
[0646] had (154) 
[0647] been (418) 
[0648] abandoned (912) 
[0649] as (595) 
[0650] hopeless (127) 
[0651] by (892) 
[0652] the (547) 
[0653] official (385) 
[0654] police (107) 
[0655] From (975) 
[0656] time (823) 
[0657] to (354) 
[0658] time (456) 
[0659] I (311) 
[0660] heard (869) 
[0661] some (586) 
[0662] vague (870) 
[0663] account (422) 
[0664] of (157) 
[0665] his (221) 
[0666] doings (594) 
[0667] of (389) 
[0668] his (521) 
[0669] summons (222) 
[0670] to (336) 
[0671] Odessa (104) 
[0672] in (533) 
[0673] the (292) 
[0674] case (20) 
[0675] of (979) 
[0676] the (353) 
[0677] Trepoff (283) 
[0678] murder, (962) 
[0679] of (299) 
[0680] his (276) 
[0681] clearing (211) 
[0682] up (43) 
[0683] of (480) 
[0684] the (89) 
[0685] singular (410) 
[0686] tragedy (252) 
[0687] of (854) 
[0688] the (242) 
[0689] Atkinson (98) 
[0690] brothers (335) 
[0691] at (311) 
[0692] Trincomalee, (381) 
[0693] and (331) 
[0694] finally (639) 
[0695] of (872) 
[0696] the (614) 
[0697] mission (796) 
[0698] which (110) 
[0699] he (257) 
[0700] had (199) 
[0701] accomplished (882) 
[0702] so (657) 
[0703] delicately (156) 
[0704] and (876) 
[0705] successfully (72) 
[0706] for (218) 
[0707] the (17) 
[0708] reigning (769) 
[0709] family (224) 
[0710] of (693) 
[0711] Holland (812) 
[0712] Beyond (445) 
[0713] these (768) 
[0714] signs (677) 
[0715] of (88) 
[0716] his (968) 
[0717] activity, (454) 
[0718] however, (423) 
[0719] which (742) 
[0720] I (859) 
[0721] merely (411) 
[0722] shared (921) 
[0723] with (203) 
[0724] all (325) 
[0725] the (4) 
[0726] readers (226) 
[0727] of (222) 
[0728] the (29) 
[0729] daily (840) 
[0730] press, (224) 
[0731] I (864) 
[0732] knew (838) 
[0733] little (540) 
[0734] of (928) 
[0735] my (229) 
[0736] former (700) 
[0737] friend (671) 
[0738] and (994) 
[0739] companion (203) 
[0740] One (405) 
[0741] night (32) 
[0742] it (140) 
[0743] was (889) 
[0744] on (519) 
[0745] the (449) 
[0746] twentieth (548) 
[0747] of (808) 
[0748] March, (954) 
[0749] 1888 (275) 
[0750] I (884) 
[0751] was (641) 
[0752] returning (987) 
[0753] from (273) 
[0754] a (899) 
[0755] journey (406) 
[0756] to (978) 
[0757] a (424) 
[0758] patient (936) 
[0759] for (788) 
[0760] I (834) 
[0761] had (421) 
[0762] now (940) 
[0763] returned (671) 
[0764] to (754) 
[0765] civil (601) 
[0766] practice (756) 
[0767] , (643) 
[0768] when (435) 
[0769] my (35) 
[0770] way (786) 
[0771] led (277) 
[0772] me (483) 
[0773] through (361) 
[0774] Baker (594) 
[0775] Street (284) 
[0776] As (584) 
[0777] I (323) 
[0778] passed (851) 
[0779] the (545) 
[0780] well (168) 
[0781] remembered (149) 
[0782] door, (447) 
[0783] which (968) 
[0784] must (715) 
[0785] always (937) 
[0786] be (617) 
[0787] associated (594) 
[0788] in (623) 
[0789] my (104) 
[0790] mind (333) 
[0791] with (405) 
[0792] my (821) 
[0793] wooing, (341) 
[0794] and (885) 
[0795] with (981) 
[0796] the (410) 
[0797] dark (160) 
[0798] incidents (89) 
[0799] of (860) 
[0800] the (319) 
[0801] Study (954) 
[0802] in (703) 
[0803] Scarlet, (59) 
[0804] I (725) 
[0805] was (511) 
[0806] seized (243) 
[0807] with (617) 
[0808] a (188) 
[0809] keen (176) 
[0810] desire (883) 
[0811] to (276) 
[0812] see (882) 
[0813] Holmes (890) 
[0814] again, (56) 
[0815] and (798) 
[0816] to (85) 
[0817] know (797) 
[0818] how (617) 
[0819] he (488) 
[0820] was (335) 
[0821] employing (766) 
[0822] his (754) 
[0823] extraordinary (502) 
[0824] powers (924) 
[0825] His (301) 
[0826] rooms (201) 
[0827] were (390) 
[0828] brilliantly (744) 
[0829] lit, (431) 
[0830] and, (119) 
[0831] even (655) 
[0832] as (812) 
[0833] I (587) 
[0834] looked (604) 
[0835] up, (438) 
[0836] I (768) 
[0837] saw (290) 
[0838] his (999) 
[0839] tall, (231) 
[0840] spare (403) 
[0841] figure (321) 
[0842] pass (960) 
[0843] twice (303) 
[0844] in (563) 
[0845] a (68) 
[0846] dark (297) 
[0847] silhouette (853) 
[0848] against (685) 
[0849] the (630) 
[0850] blind (967) 
[0851] He (501) 
[0852] was (663) 
[0853] pacing (637) 
[0854] the (630) 
[0855] room (921) 
[0856] swiftly, (935) 
[0857] eagerly, (534) 
[0858] with (422) 
[0859] his (875) 
[0860] head (686) 
[0861] sunk (889) 
[0862] upon (384) 
[0863] his (796) 
[0864] chest (30) 
[0865] and (446) 
[0866] his (343) 
[0867] hands (63) 
[0868] clasped (8) 
[0869] behind (758) 
[0870] him (681) 
[0871] To (483) 
[0872] me, (0) 
[0873] who (56) 
[0874] knew (173) 
[0875] his (402) 
[0876] every (222) 
[0877] mood (964) 
[0878] and (358) 
[0879] habit, (775) 
[0880] his (675) 
[0881] attitude (595) 
[0882] and (15) 
[0883] manner (683) 
[0884] told (149) 
[0885] their (493) 
[0886] own (225) 
[0887] story (31) 
[0888] He (115) 
[0889] was (406) 
[0890] at (950) 
[0891] work (576) 
[0892] again (94) 
[0893] He (103) 
[0894] had (989) 
[0895] risen (349) 
[0896] out (489) 
[0897] of (395) 
[0898] his (583) 
[0899] drug (753) 
[0900] created (707) 
[0901] dreams (482) 
[0902] and (698) 
[0903] was (278) 
[0904] hot (42) 
[0905] upon (722) 
[0906] the (402) 
[0907] scent (883) 
[0908] of (693) 
[0909] some (938) 
[0910] new (292) 
[0911] problem (180) 
[0912] I (807) 
[0913] rang (56) 
[0914] the (429) 
[0915] bell (553) 
[0916] and (419) 
[0917] was (234) 
[0918] shown (79) 
[0919] up (643) 
[0920] to (151) 
[0921] the (495) 
[0922] chamber (114) 
[0923] which (979) 
[0924] had (687) 
[0925] formerly (195) 
[0926] been (745) 
[0927] in (719) 
[0928] part (145) 
[0929] my (516) 
[0930] own (485) 
[0931] His (887) 
[0932] manner (682) 
[0933] was (513) 
[0934] not (778) 
[0935] effusive (989) 
[0936] It (784) 
[0937] seldom (177) 
[0938] was; (423) 
[0939] but (896) 
[0940] he (998) 
[0941] was (241) 
[0942] glad, (568) 
[0943] I (293) 
[0944] think, (117) 
[0945] to (744) 
[0946] see (332) 
[0947] me (995) 
[0948] With (988) 
[0949] hardly (562) 
[0950] a (558) 
[0951] word (878) 
[0952] spoken, (950) 
[0953] but (626) 
[0954] with (302) 
[0955] a (954) 
[0956] kindly (88) 
[0957] eye, (795) 
[0958] he (115) 
[0959] waved (761) 
[0960] me (371) 
[0961] to (597) 
[0962] an (876) 
[0963] armchair, (295) 
[0964] threw (443) 
[0965] across (38) 
[0966] his (644) 
[0967] case (252) 
[0968] of (553) 
[0969] cigars, (971) 
[0970] and (205) 
[0971] indicated (64) 
[0972] a (395) 
[0973] spirit (893) 
[0974] case (73) 
[0975] and (256) 
[0976] a (842) 
[0977] gasogene (137) 
[0978] in (304) 
[0979] the (698) 
[0980] corner (354) 
[0981] Then (358) 
[0982] he (832) 
[0983] stood (702) 
[0984] before (671) 
[0985] the (783) 
[0986] fire (531) 
[0987] and (367) 
[0988] looked (528) 
[0989] me (74) 
[0990] over (556) 
[0991] in (526) 
[0992] his (796) 
[0993] singular (562) 
[0994] introspective (520) 
[0995] fashion (759) 
[0996] "Wedlock (331) 
[0997] suits (887) 
[0998] you," (401) 
[0999] he (427) 
[1000] remarked (64) 
[1001] "I (875) 
[1002] think, (875) 
[1003] Watson, (816) 
[1004] that (458) 
[1005] you (465) 
[1006] have (643) 
[1007] put (381) 
[1008] on (934) 
[1009] seven (786) 
[1010] and (631) 
[1011] a (417) 
[1012] half (292) 
[1013] pounds (184) 
[1014] since (222) 
[1015] I (927) 
[1016] saw (838) 
[1017] you (427) 
[1018] " (239) 
[1019] "Seven (735) 
[1020] " (132) 
[1021] I (494) 
[1022] answered (947) 
[1023] "Indeed, (636) 
[1024] I (215) 
[1025] should (840) 
[1026] have (817) 
[1027] thought (503) 
[1028] a (781) 
[1029] little (212) 
[1030] more (640) 
[1031] Just (894) 
[1032] a (640) 
[1033] trifle (162) 
[1034] more, (752) 
[1035] I (135) 
[1036] fancy, (722) 
[1037] Watson (418) 
[1038] And (891) 
[1039] in (900) 
[1040] practice (588) 
[1041] again, (127) 
[1042] I (18) 
[1043] observe (180) 
[1044] You (998) 
[1045] did (53) 
[1046] not (555) 
[1047] tell (53) 
[1048] me (299) 
[1049] that (138) 
[1050] you (2) 
[1051] intended (252) 
[1052] to (241) 
[1053] go (796) 
[1054] into (974) 
[1055] harness (413) 
[1056] " (9) 
[1057] "Then, (383) 
[1058] how (384) 
[1059] do (579) 
[1060] you (662) 
[1061] know?" (198) 
[1062] "I (133) 
[1063] see (945) 
[1064] it, (546) 
[1065] I (934) 
[1066] deduce (275) 
[1067] it (640) 
[1068] How (30) 
[1069] do (960) 
[1070] I (923) 
[1071] know (168) 
[1072] that (264) 
[1073] you (916) 
[1074] have (546) 
[1075] been (559) 
[1076] getting (285) 
[1077] yourself (39) 
[1078] very (533) 
[1079] wet (524) 
[1080] lately, (271) 
[1081] and (972) 
[1082] that (799) 
[1083] you (971)

[1092] "My (344)

[1099] too (453) 
[1100] much (68)

[1114] It (439) 
[1115] is (85) 
[1116] true (200) 
[1117] that (600) 
[1118] I (591) 
[1119] had (437) 
[1120] a (116)

[1123] on (272) 
[1124] Thursday (362) 
[1125] and (959) 
[1126] came (545) 
[1127] home (312) 
[1128] in (960) 
[1129] a (908) 
[1130] dreadful (769) 
[1131] mess, (836) 
[1132] but (397) 
[1133] as (727) 
[1134] I (508) 
[1135] have (666) 
[1136] changed (990) 
[1137] my (919) 
[1138] clothes (343)

[1140] can (679)

[1151] she (864) 
[1152] is (673) 
[1153] incorrigible, (643) 
[1154] and (556) 
[1155] my (928) 
[1156] wife (579) 
[1157] has (956) 
[1158] given (126) 
[1159] her (663) 
[1160] notice, (294) 
[1161] but (69) 
[1162] there, (569) 
[1163] again, (689) 
[1164] I (772) 
[1165] fail (750) 
[1166] to (226) 
[1167] see (520) 
[1168] how (532) 
[1169] you (695)

[1175] chuckled (996) 
[1176] to (884) 
[1177] himself (678) 
[1178] and (454) 
[1179] rubbed (778)

[1187] simplicity (118) 
[1188] itself," (450)

[1190] he; (198) 
[1191] "my (198)

[1215] almost (17) 
[1216] parallel (832)

[1222] caused (32) 
[1223] by (524) 
[1224] someone (312) 
[1225] who (860) 
[1226] has (960) 
[1227] very (19) 
[1228] carelessly (746) 
[1229] scraped (235) 
[1230] round (356) 
[1231] the (431) 
[1232] edges (205) 
[1233] of (114) 
[1234] the (901)

[1246] see, (842) 
[1247] my (850) 
[1248] double (998) 
[1249] deduction (731) 
[1250] that (214) 
[1251] you (932) 
[1252] had (640) 
[1253] been (217) 
[1254] out (569) 
[1255] in (160) 
[1256] vile (894) 
[1257] weather, (966) 
[1258] and (672) 
[1259] that (717) 
[1260] you (458) 
[1261] had (597) 
[1262] a (826) 
[1263] particularly (384) 
[1264] malignant (113) 
[1265] boot (614) 
[1266] slitting (930) 
[1267] specimen (884) 
[1268] of (440) 
[1269] the (544) 
[1270] London (830) 
[1271] slavey (15) 
[1272] As (608) 
[1273] to (734) 
[1274] your (807) 
[1275] practice, (945) 
[1276] if (472) 
[1277] a (256) 
[1278] gentleman (495) 
[1279] walks (713) 
[1280] into (444) 
[1281] my (584) 
[1282] rooms (564) 
[1283] smelling (532) 
[1284] of (396) 
[1285] iodoform, (417) 
[1286] with (137) 
[1287] a (520) 
[1288] black (585) 
[1289] mark (312) 
[1290] of (930) 
[1291] nitrate (794) 
[1292] of (121) 
[1293] silver (791) 
[1294] upon (200) 
[1295] his (622) 
[1296] right (580) 
[1297] forefinger, (494) 
[1298] and (0) 
[1299] a (348) 
[1300] bulge (54) 
[1301] on (544) 
[1302] the (466) 
[1303] right (721) 
[1304] side (345) 
[1305] of (635) 
[1306] his (45) 
[1307] top (18)

[1309] to (817) 
[1310] show (423) 
[1311] where (594) 
[1312] he (92) 
[1313] has (122) 
[1314] secreted (187) 
[1315] his (205) 
[1316] stethoscope, (16) 
[1317] I (810) 
[1318] must (213) 
[1319] be (211) 
[1320] dull, (506) 
[1321] indeed, (237) 
[1322] if (399) 
[1323] I (402) 
[1324] do (689) 
[1325] not (993) 
[1326] pronounce (248) 
[1327] him (620) 
[1328] to (270) 
[1329] be (513) 
[1330] an (241) 
[1331] active (938) 
[1332] member (115) 
[1333] of (266) 
[1334] the (550) 
[1335] medical (576) 
[1336] profession (442) 
[1337] " (276) 
[1338] I (670) 
[1339] could (372) 
[1340] not (121) 
[1341] help (717) 
[1342] laughing (111) 
[1343] at (364) 
[1344] the (516) 
[1345] ease (898) 
[1346] with (763) 
[1347] which (576) 
[1348] he (253) 
[1349] explained (126) 
[1350] his (172) 
[1351] process (687) 
[1352] of (529) 
[1353] deduction (18) 
[1354] "When (588) 
[1355] I (677)

[1357] you (791) 
[1358] give (37) 
[1359] your (245) 
[1360] reasons," (266) 
[1361] I (141) 
[1362] remarked, (300) 
[1363] "the (183)

[1366] appears (332) 
[1367] to (791) 
[1368] me (838)

[1370] be (578) 
[1371] so (684) 
[1372] ridiculously (770) 
[1373] simple (865) 
[1374] that (27) 
[1375] I (657) 
[1376] could (96) 
[1377] easily (179) 
[1378] do (851) 
[1379] it (914) 
[1380] myself, (428) 
[1381] though (278) 
[1382] at (976) 
[1383] each (53) 
[1384] successive (25)

[1386] of (255) 
[1387] your (90) 
[1388] reasoning (440) 
[1389] I (619) 
[1390] am (702) 
[1391] baffled (733) 
[1392] until (943) 
[1393] you (189) 
[1394] explain (361) 
[1395] your (104) 
[1396] process (747)

[1398] yet (220) 
[1399] I (200) 
[1400] believe (229) 
[1401] that (275) 
[1402] my (582) 
[1403] eyes (760)

[1410] "Quite (830) 
[1411] so," (674) 
[1412] he (293) 
[1413] answered, (815) 
[1414] lighting (37) 
[1415] a (526) 
[1416] cigarette, (888) 
[1417] and (552) 
[1418] throwing (406) 
[1419] himself (752) 
[1420] down (393) 
[1421] into (893) 
[1422] an (694) 
[1423] armchair (504) 
[1424] "You (814)

[1427] you (857) 
[1428] do (74) 
[1429] not (254)

[1432] distinction (17)

[1435] For (393) 
[1436] example, (269) 
[1437] you (733)

[2287] bands (498)

[2316] flame (295) 
[2317] coloured (818) 
[2318] silk (92) 
[2319] and (125) 
[2320] secured (57) 
[2321] at (861) 
[2322] the (449) 
[2323] neck (420) 
[2324] with (414) 
[2325] a (125) 
[2326] brooch (462) 
[2327] which (728) 
[2328] consisted (644)

[2349] rich (524) 
[2350] brown (241) 
[2351] fur, (963) 
[2352] completed (969) 
[2353] the (733) 
[2354] impression (882) 
[2355] of (285) 
[2356] barbaric (434) 
[2357] opulence (618) 
[2358] which (553) 
[2359] was (844) 
[2360] suggested (990) 
[2361] by (353) 
[2362] his (237) 
[2363] whole (983) 
[2364] appearance (958) 
[2365] He (10) 
[2366] carried (87) 
[2367] a (543)

[2369] brimmed (450) 
[2370] hat (421) 
[2371] in (323) 
[2372] his (146) 
[2373] hand, (272) 
[2374] while (492) 
[2375] he (248) 
[2376] wore (533) 
[2377] across (979) 
[2378] the (815) 
[2379] upper (342) 
[2380] part (284) 
[2381] of (342) 
[2382] his (919) 
[2383] face, (370) 
[2384] extending (680) 
[2385] down (720) 
[2386] past (386) 
[2387] the (934) 
[2388] cheekbones, (235) 
[2389] a (695) 
[2390] black (98) 
[2391] vizard (913) 
[2392] mask, (244) 
[2393] which (75) 
[2394] he (5) 
[2395] had (554) 
[2396] apparently (893) 
[2397] adjusted (374) 
[2398] that (938) 
[2399] very (147) 
[2400] moment, (361) 
[2401] for (27) 
[2402] his (420) 
[2403] hand (914) 
[2404] was (491) 
[2405] still (694) 
[2406] raised (768) 
[2407] to (175) 
[2408] it (471) 
[2409] as (7) 
[2410] he (980) 
[2411] entered (578) 
[2412] From (497) 
[2413] the (39) 
[2414] lower (270) 
[2415] part (503) 
[2416] of (73) 
[2417] the (653) 
[2418] face (576) 
[2419] he (255) 
[2420] appeared (267) 
[2421] to (55) 
[2422] be (259) 
[2423] a (636) 
[2424] man (21) 
[2425] of (485) 
[2426] strong (606) 
[2427] character, (971) 
[2428] with (220) 
[2429] a (90) 
[2430] thick, (775) 
[2431] hanging (364) 
[2432] lip, (553) 
[2433] and (362) 
[2434] a (739) 
[2435] long, (240) 
[2436] straight (281) 
[2437] chin (895) 
[2438] suggestive (567) 
[2439] of (104) 
[2440] resolution (254) 
[2441] pushed (793) 
[2442] to (846) 
[2443] the (535) 
[2444] length (782) 
[2445] of (777) 
[2446] obstinacy (445) 
[2447] "You (687) 
[2448] had (686) 
[2449] my (620) 
[2450] note?" (745) 
[2451] he (937) 
[2452] asked (361) 
[2453] with (636) 
[2454] a (337) 
[2455] deep (584) 
[2456] harsh (49) 
[2457] voice (811) 
[2458] and (573) 
[2459] a (355) 
[2460] strongly (925) 
[2461] marked (886) 
[2462] German (128) 
[2463] accent (280) 
[2464] "I (588)

[2472] He (228) 
[2473] looked (642) 
[2474] from (369) 
[2475] one (442) 
[2476] to (117) 
[2477] the (426) 
[2478] other (86)

[2492] Holmes (270) 
[2493] "This (966)

[2578] the (39) 
[2579] wrist (661)

[2762] plainly, (636) 
[2763] the (190) 
[2764] matter (760)

[2782] murmured (523) 
[2783] Holmes, (77) 
[2784] settling (341) 
[2785] himself (463)

[2793] eyes (141) 
[2794] Our (284) 
[2795] visitor (900) 
[2796] glanced (300) 
[2797] with (301) 
[2798] some (137) 
[2799] apparent (998) 
[2800] surprise (884) 
[2801] at (315) 
[2802] the (183) 
[2803] languid, (643) 
[2804] lounging (592) 
[2805] figure (764) 
[2806] of (571) 
[2807] the (67) 
[2808] man (809)

[2811] been (277) 
[2812] no (506) 
[2813] doubt (754) 
[2814] depicted (251) 
[2815] to (287) 
[2816] him (229) 
[2817] as (615) 
[2818] the (815) 
[2819] most (903) 
[2820] incisive (790) 
[2821] reasoner (74) 
[2822] and (702) 
[2823] most (178) 
[2824] energetic (360) 
[2825] agent (537) 
[2826] in (563) 
[2827] Europe (278) 
[2828] Holmes (757) 
[2829] slowly (328) 
[2830] reopened (378) 
[2831] his (332) 
[2832] eyes (894) 
[2833] and (471) 
[2834] looked (396) 
[2835] impatiently (54) 
[2836] at (204) 
[2837] his (906) 
[2838] gigantic (394) 
[2839] client (925) 
[2840] "If (282) 
[2841] your (475)

[2847] your (230) 
[2848] case," (894) 
[2849] he (859) 
[2850] remarked, (574) 
[2851] "I (826)

[2860] The (461) 
[2861] man (439) 
[2862] sprang (445) 
[2863] from (137) 
[2864] his (112) 
[2865] chair (122) 
[2866] and (730) 
[2867] paced (113) 
[2868] up (69)

[2870] down (272) 
[2871] the (458) 
[2872] room (594) 
[2873] in (739) 
[2874] uncontrollable (686) 
[2875] agitation (396) 
[2876] Then, (878) 
[2877] with (71) 
[2878] a (72) 
[2879] gesture (597) 
[2880] of (926) 
[2881] desperation, (992) 
[2882] he (305) 
[2883] tore (772) 
[2884] the (203) 
[2885] mask (25) 
[2886] from (954) 
[2887] his (642) 
[2888] face (644) 
[2889] and (755) 
[2890] hurled (673) 
[2891] it (318) 
[2892] upon (927) 
[2893] the (32) 
[2894] ground (540) 
[2895] "You (456) 
[2896] are (682) 
[2897] right," (282) 
[2898] he (136) 
[2899] cried; (780) 
[2900] "I (59)

[2911] "Why, (576)

[2914] Holmes (338) 
[2915] "Your (349)

[3945] I (709)

[3947] already (773) 
[3948] recorded, (899) 
[3949] still, (335) 
[3950] the (89) 
[3951] nature (246) 
[3952] of (269)

[3966] of (638) 
[3967] its (338)

[3970] apart (356) 
[3971] from (766) 
[3972] the (762) 
[3973] nature (686)

[3975] the (11) 
[3976] investigation (328) 
[3977] which (700) 
[3978] my (155) 
[3979] friend (727) 
[3980] had (628) 
[3981] on (714)

[3986] in (128) 
[3987] his (736) 
[3988] masterly (827) 
[3989] grasp (897) 
[3990] of (529) 
[3991] a (836) 
[3992] situation, (782) 
[3993] and (636) 
[3994] his (77) 
[3995] keen, (124) 
[3996] incisive (689) 
[3997] reasoning, (592) 
[3998] which (36) 
[3999] made (637) 
[4000] it (876) 
[4001] a (507) 
[4002] pleasure (27) 
[4003] to (555) 
[4004] me (958) 
[4005] to (736) 
[4006] study (494) 
[4007] his (704) 
[4008] system (677) 
[4009] of (959) 
[4010] work, (495) 
[4011] and (729) 
[4012] to (17) 
[4013] follow (213) 
[4014] the (359) 
[4015] quick, (749) 
[4016] subtle (720) 
[4017] methods (597) 
[4018] by (891) 
[4019] which (301) 
[4020] he (448) 
[4021] disentangled (981) 
[4022] the (908) 
[4023] most (173) 
[4024] inextricable (308) 
[4025] mysteries (295) 
[4026] So (116) 
[4027] accustomed (303) 
[4028] was (349) 
[4029] I (626) 
[4030] to (180) 
[4031] his (34) 
[4032] invariable (795) 
[4033] success (362) 
[4034] that (370) 
[4035] the (906) 
[4036] very (406) 
[4037] possibility (934) 
[4038] of (677) 
[4039] his (501) 
[4040] failing (577) 
[4041] had (665) 
[4042] ceased (461) 
[4043] to (19) 
[4044] enter (715) 
[4045] into (552) 
[4046] my (349) 
[4047] head (905) 
[4048] It (444) 
[4049] was (537) 
[4050] close (538) 
[4051] upon (309) 
[4052] four (594) 
[4053] before (868) 
[4054] the (66) 
[4055] door (832) 
[4056] opened, (329) 
[4057] and (126)

[4059] drunken (264) 
[4060] looking (97) 
[4061] groom, (149)

[4070] face (888) 
[4071] and (968) 
[4072] disreputable (986) 
[4073] clothes, (454) 
[4074] walked (484) 
[4075] into (70) 
[4076] the (638) 
[4077] room (862) 
[4078] Accustomed (179) 
[4079] as (393) 
[4080] I (331) 
[4081] was (337) 
[4082] to (698) 
[4083] my (952) 
[4084] friend (594) 
[4085] s (977) 
[4086] amazing (605) 
[4087] powers (727) 
[4088] in (95) 
[4089] the (662) 
[4090] use (955) 
[4091] of (743) 
[4092] disguises, (530) 
[4093] I (269) 
[4094] had (710) 
[4095] to (380) 
[4096] look (697) 
[4097] three (4) 
[4098] times (566) 
[4099] before (872) 
[4100] I (417) 
[4101] was (14) 
[4102] certain (973) 
[4103] that (796) 
[4104] it (288) 
[4105] was (348) 
[4106] indeed (890)

[4108] With (725) 
[4109] a (279) 
[4110] nod (934) 
[4111] he (807) 
[4112] vanished (222) 
[4113] into (242) 
[4114] the (466) 
[4115] bedroom, (439) 
[4116] whence (605) 
[4117] he (111) 
[4118] emerged (988) 
[4119] in (741) 
[4120] five (772) 
[4121] minutes (646) 
[4122] tweed (983) 
[4123] suited (891) 
[4124] and (413) 
[4125] respectable, (939) 
[4126] as (468) 
[4127] of (905) 
[4128] old (895) 
[4129] Putting (988) 
[4130] his (544) 
[4131] hands (770) 
[4132] into (881) 
[4133] his (94) 
[4134] pockets, (171) 
[4135] he (295) 
[4136] stretched (879) 
[4137] out (980) 
[4138] his (395) 
[4139] legs (598) 
[4140] in (830) 
[4141] front (266) 
[4142] of (306) 
[4143] the (119) 
[4144] fire (67) 
[4145] and (528) 
[4146] laughed (556) 
[4147] heartily (158) 
[4148] for (901) 
[4149] some (824) 
[4150] minutes (935) 
[4151] "Well, (758) 
[4152] really (249) 
[4153] " (703) 
[4154] he (35) 
[4155] cried, (94) 
[4156] and (387) 
[4157] then (599) 
[4158] he (376) 
[4159] choked (763) 
[4160] and (235) 
[4161] laughed (0) 
[4162] again (472) 
[4163] until (605) 
[4164] he (223) 
[4165] was (799) 
[4166] obliged (101) 
[4167] to (892) 
[4168] lie (775) 
[4169] back, (596)

[4778] balancing (747) 
[4779] the (333)

[4878] excitedly, (273)

[4881] his (471)

[4892] looking (649) 
[4893] even (562) 
[4894] more (565) 
[4895] flurried (402) 
[4896] than (300) 
[4897] before (432)

[4910] from (131) 
[4911] his (236) 
[4912] pocket (846)

[4919] like (410) 
[4920] the (487) 
[4921] devil, (885)

[4923] shouted, (969)

[4959] I (805) 
[4960] was (143) 
[4961] just (536) 
[4962] wondering (78)

[5291] What (798) 
[5292] then? (702) 
[5293] I (754)

[5386] beamed (169) 
[5387] on (521) 
[5388] me (945) 
[5389] in (995) 
[5390] front (644)

[5392] was (199) 
[5393] the (442) 
[5394] most (917) 
[5395] preposterous (269) 
[5396] position (722) 
[5397] in (348) 
[5398] which (137)

[5413] that (719) 
[5414] started (69) 
[5415] me (588) 
[5416] laughing (862) 
[5417] just (518) 
[5418] now (879)

[6187] the (456)

[6201] the (541)

[6241] the (308) 
[6242] locality (378) 
[6243] appeared (630) 
[6244] to (427) 
[6245] be (567) 
[6246] less (606) 
[6247] private (522) 
[6248] than (488) 
[6249] I (820) 
[6250] expected (86)

[6258] in (386) 
[6259] a (180) 
[6260] quiet (720) 
[6261] neighbourhood, (981) 
[6262] it (965) 
[6263] was (680) 
[6264] remarkably (62) 
[6265] animated (566) 
[6266] There (535) 
[6267] was (538) 
[6268] a (899) 
[6269] group (76) 
[6270] of (85) 
[6271] shabbily (878) 
[6272] dressed (641) 
[6273] men (124) 
[6274] smoking (451) 
[6275] and (756) 
[6276] laughing (531) 
[6277] in (577) 
[6278] a (961) 
[6279] corner, (489) 
[6280] a (527) 
[6281] scissors (617) 
[6282] grinder (620) 
[6283] with (816) 
[6284] his (811) 
[6285] wheel, (403) 
[6286] two (800) 
[6287] guardsmen (661) 
[6288] who (933) 
[6289] were (643) 
[6290] flirting (714) 
[6291] with (615) 
[6292] a (79) 
[6293] nurse (657) 
[6294] girl, (487) 
[6295] and (726) 
[6296] several (775) 
[6297] well (488) 
[6298] dressed (451) 
[6299] young (258) 
[6300] men (434) 
[6301] who (684) 
[6302] were (153) 
[6303] lounging (401) 
[6304] up (540) 
[6305] and (699) 
[6306] down (974) 
[6307] with (792) 
[6308] cigars (686)

[6310] their (567) 
[6311] mouths (48) 
[6312] "You (80) 
[6313] see," (517) 
[6314] remarked (182) 
[6315] Holmes, (833) 
[6316] as (244) 
[6317] we (90) 
[6318] paced (837)

[6322] in (61) 
[6323] front (60) 
[6324] of (434)

[6326] house, (595) 
[6327] "this (206) 
[6328] marriage (684)

[6740] and (821) 
[6741] struggling (948) 
[6742] men, (546) 
[6743] who (46) 
[6744] struck (454) 
[6745] savagely (444) 
[6746] at (623) 
[6747] each (340) 
[6748] other (862)

[6762] lady; (763)

[6765] as (68) 
[6766] he (931) 
[6767] reached (242) 
[6768] her, (109) 
[6769] he (623) 
[6770] gave (430) 
[6771] a (953) 
[6772] cry (801) 
[6773] and (130) 
[6774] dropped (223) 
[6775] to (869) 
[6776] the (569) 
[6777] ground, (558) 
[6778] with (822) 
[6779] the (660) 
[6780] blood (86) 
[6781] running (688)

[6783] down (578) 
[6784] his (146)

[6788] fall (317) 
[6789] the (215) 
[6790] guardsmen (243)

[6792] to (904) 
[6793] their (693) 
[6794] heels (370) 
[6795] in (271) 
[6796] one (816) 
[6797] direction (633) 
[6798] and (99) 
[6799] the (501) 
[6800] loungers (543) 
[6801] in (684) 
[6802] the (855)

[6808] better (889) 
[6809] dressed (82) 
[6810] people, (227) 
[6811] who (539) 
[6812] had (163) 
[6813] watched (422) 
[6814] the (692) 
[6815] scuffle (339) 
[6816] without (342) 
[6817] taking (287) 
[6818] part (248) 
[6819] in (272) 
[6820] it, (260) 
[6821] crowded (498) 
[6822] in (655) 
[6823] to (591) 
[6824] help (372) 
[6825] the (808) 
[6826] lady (685)

[6828] to (856) 
[6829] attend (146)

[6837] I (841)

[6839] still (203) 
[6840] call (941) 
[6841] her, (591) 
[6842] had (739) 
[6843] hurried (285) 
[6844] up (132) 
[6845] the (212) 
[6846] steps; (728) 
[6847] but (998) 
[6848] she (354) 
[6849] stood (208) 
[6850] at (638) 
[6851] the (313) 
[6852] top (97) 
[6853] with (252) 
[6854] her (294) 
[6855] superb (217) 
[6856] figure (336) 
[6857] outlined (670)

[6861] of (284)

[6867] the (792) 
[6868] street (550)

[6875] she (185)

[6877] "He (120)

[7051] never (28) 
[7052] felt (501) 
[7053] more (89) 
[7054] heartily (986) 
[7055] ashamed (43) 
[7056] of (841) 
[7057] myself (875) 
[7058] in (9) 
[7059] my (247) 
[7060] life (554) 
[7061] than (608) 
[7062] when (967) 
[7063] I (843) 
[7064] saw (148) 
[7065] the (667) 
[7066] beautiful (230) 
[7067] creature (281) 
[7068] against (520) 
[7069] whom (364) 
[7070] I (229) 
[7071] was (382) 
[7072] conspiring, (710) 
[7073] or (892) 
[7074] the (825) 
[7075] grace (14) 
[7076] and (315) 
[7077] kindliness (831) 
[7078] with (644) 
[7079] which (607) 
[7080] she (225) 
[7081] waited (644) 
[7082] upon (167) 
[7083] the (231) 
[7084] injured (190) 
[7085] man (789) 
[7086] And (920) 
[7087] yet (156) 
[7088] it (861) 
[7089] would (568) 
[7090] be (541) 
[7091] the (604) 
[7092] blackest (77) 
[7093] treachery (505) 
[7094] to (969) 
[7095] Holmes (491) 
[7096] to (901) 
[7097] draw (721) 
[7098] back (851) 
[7099] now (545) 
[7100] from (130) 
[7101] the (453) 
[7102] part (825) 
[7103] which (371) 
[7104] he (509) 
[7105] had (627) 
[7106] intrusted (609) 
[7107] to (140) 
[7108] me (316) 
[7109] I (826) 
[7110] hardened (900) 
[7111] my (845) 
[7112] heart, (657) 
[7113] and (548) 
[7114] took (691) 
[7115] the (685) 
[7116] smoke (575) 
[7117] rocket (672) 
[7118] from (544) 
[7119] under (452) 
[7120] my (236) 
[7121] ulster (393) 
[7122] After (427) 
[7123] all, (884) 
[7124] I (185) 
[7125] thought, (87) 
[7126] we (877) 
[7127] are (591) 
[7128] not (214) 
[7129] injuring (804) 
[7130] her (616) 
[7131] We (523) 
[7132] are (424) 
[7133] but (880) 
[7134] preventing (739) 
[7135] her (113) 
[7136] from (343) 
[7137] injuring (373) 
[7138] another (275) 
[7139] Holmes (444) 
[7140] had (453) 
[7141] sat (110) 
[7142] up (660) 
[7143] upon (21) 
[7144] the (991) 
[7145] couch, (360) 
[7146] and (86) 
[7147] I (541) 
[7148] saw (67) 
[7149] him (513) 
[7150] motion (429) 
[7151] like (638) 
[7152] a (786) 
[7153] man (688) 
[7154] who (70) 
[7155] is (181) 
[7156] in (858) 
[7157] need (316) 
[7158] of (658) 
[7159] air (908) 
[7160] A (901) 
[7161] maid (779) 
[7162] rushed (40) 
[7163] across (936) 
[7164] and (308) 
[7165] threw (800) 
[7166] open (294) 
[7167] the (449) 
[7168] window (489) 
[7169] At (102) 
[7170] the (228) 
[7171] same (945) 
[7172] instant (425) 
[7173] I (13) 
[7174] saw (930) 
[7175] him (193) 
[7176] raise (8) 
[7177] his (13) 
[7178] hand (264) 
[7179] and (512) 
[7180] at (158) 
[7181] the (970) 
[7182] signal (72) 
[7183] I (529) 
[7184] tossed (684) 
[7185] my (657) 
[7186] rocket (52) 
[7187] into (515) 
[7188] the (450) 
[7189] room (531) 
[7190] with (723) 
[7191] a (697) 
[7192] cry (18) 
[7193] of (705) 
[7194] "Fire (104) 
[7195] " (899) 
[7196] The (131) 
[7197] word (347) 
[7198] was (667) 
[7199] no (312) 
[7200] sooner (52) 
[7201] out (267) 
[7202] of (928) 
[7203] my (714) 
[7204] mouth (212) 
[7205] than (489) 
[7206] the (652) 
[7207] whole (498) 
[7208] crowd (203) 
[7209] of (162) 
[7210] spectators, (937) 
[7211] well (231) 
[7212] dressed (558) 
[7213] and (570) 
[7214] ill (493) 
[7215] gentlemen, (608) 
[7216] ostlers, (149) 
[7217] and (239) 
[7218] servant (248) 
[7219] maids (577) 
[7220] joined (987) 
[7221] in (501) 
[7222] a (197) 
[7223] general (830) 
[7224] shriek (508) 
[7225] of (335) 
[7226] "Fire (226) 
[7227] " (886) 
[7228] Thick (371) 
[7229] clouds (662) 
[7230] of (863) 
[7231] smoke (35) 
[7232] curled (406) 
[7233] through (901) 
[7234] the (258) 
[7235] room (223) 
[7236] and (231) 
[7237] out (153) 
[7238] at (753) 
[7239] the (591) 
[7240] open (59) 
[7241] window (845) 
[7242] I (23) 
[7243] caught (12) 
[7244] a (860) 
[7245] glimpse (240) 
[7246] of (14) 
[7247] rushing (353) 
[7248] figures, (427) 
[7249] and (677) 
[7250] a (536) 
[7251] moment (639) 
[7252] later (884) 
[7253] the (362) 
[7254] voice (928) 
[7255] of (589) 
[7256] Holmes (208) 
[7257] from (11) 
[7258] within (855) 
[7259] assuring (390) 
[7260] them (955) 
[7261] that (476) 
[7262] it (577) 
[7263] was (717) 
[7264] a (330) 
[7265] false (855) 
[7266] alarm (956) 
[7267] Slipping (387) 
[7268] through (643) 
[7269] the (186) 
[7270] shouting (934) 
[7271] crowd (118) 
[7272] I (668) 
[7273] made (392) 
[7274] my (286) 
[7275] way (558) 
[7276] to (314) 
[7277] the (0) 
[7278] corner (802) 
[7279] of (753) 
[7280] the (192) 
[7281] street, (70) 
[7282] and (676) 
[7283] in (409) 
[7284] ten (84) 
[7285] minutes (810) 
[7286] was (241) 
[7287] rejoiced (327) 
[7288] to (519) 
[7289] find (939) 
[7290] my (470) 
[7291] friend (741) 
[7292] s (747) 
[7293] arm (940) 
[7294] in (378) 
[7295] mine, (563) 
[7296] and (984) 
[7297] to (14) 
[7298] get (200) 
[7299] away (469) 
[7300] from (307) 
[7301] the (862) 
[7302] scene (385) 
[7303] of (176) 
[7304] uproar (512) 
[7305] He (168) 
[7306] walked (55) 
[7307] swiftly (630) 
[7308] and (928) 
[7309] in (99) 
[7310] silence (236) 
[7311] for (458) 
[7312] some (574) 
[7313] few (651) 
[7314] minutes (875) 
[7315] until (960) 
[7316] we (986) 
[7317] had (951) 
[7318] turned (347) 
[7319] down (918) 
[7320] one (615) 
[7321] of (293) 
[7322] the (869) 
[7323] quiet (852) 
[7324] streets (996) 
[7325] which (0) 
[7326] lead (176) 
[7327] towards (270) 
[7328] the (951) 
[7329] Edgeware (645) 
[7330] Road (297) 
[7331] "You (739) 
[7332] did (381) 
[7333] it (597) 
[7334] very (801) 
[7335] nicely, (135) 
[7336] Doctor," (187) 
[7337] he (47) 
[7338] remarked (397) 
[7339] "Nothing (654) 
[7340] could (420) 
[7341] have (146) 
[7342] been (771) 
[7343] better (457)

[7345] is (468) 
[7346] all (823) 
[7347] right (612)

[7349] "You (253)

[7359] "And (581) 
[7360] how (342) 
[7361] did (83) 
[7362] you (576) 
[7363] find (759) 
[7364] out?" (222) 
[7365] "She (869) 
[7366] showed (88) 
[7367] me, (10) 
[7368] as (668) 
[7369] I (725) 
[7370] told (190) 
[7371] you (356)

[7388] a (549) 
[7389] mystery," (28) 
[7390] said (764) 
[7391] he, (300) 
[7392] laughing (567) 
[7393] "The (477) 
[7394] matter (721) 
[7395] was (127) 
[7396] perfectly (998) 
[7397] simple (938) 
[7398] You, (919) 
[7399] of (428) 
[7400] course, (518) 
[7401] saw (152) 
[7402] that (166)

[7404] in (136) 
[7405] the (956)

[7418] "I (429) 
[7419] guessed (795) 
[7420] as (937) 
[7421] much (634) 
[7422] " (983) 
[7423] "Then, (593) 
[7424] when (600) 
[7425] the (438) 
[7426] row (94) 
[7427] broke (821) 
[7428] out, (205) 
[7429] I (635) 
[7430] had (876) 
[7431] a (333) 
[7432] little (732) 
[7433] moist (269) 
[7434] red (604)

[7445] fell (762) 
[7446] down, (446) 
[7447] clapped (156) 
[7448] my (425)

[7454] became (706) 
[7455] a (539) 
[7456] piteous (892) 
[7457] spectacle (343) 
[7458] It (662) 
[7459] is (735) 
[7460] an (104)

[7464] "That (43) 
[7465] also (225)

[7594] it (221) 
[7595] was (746) 
[7596] of (192) 
[7597] use (847) 
[7598] to (86) 
[7599] me, (535) 
[7600] and (823) 
[7601] also (466) 
[7602] in (952) 
[7603] the (364) 
[7604] Arnsworth (18) 
[7605] Castle (914) 
[7606] business (605) 
[7607] A (448) 
[7608] married (861) 
[7609] woman (445) 
[7610] grabs (541) 
[7611] at (534) 
[7612] her (708) 
[7613] baby; (248) 
[7614] an (598) 
[7615] unmarried (122) 
[7616] one (561) 
[7617] reaches (422) 
[7618] for (7) 
[7619] her (890) 
[7620] jewel (361) 
[7621] box (107) 
[7622] Now (372) 
[7623] it (659) 
[7624] was (728) 
[7625] clear (829) 
[7626] to (367) 
[7627] me (399) 
[7628] that (907) 
[7629] our (79) 
[7630] lady (226) 
[7631] of (517) 
[7632] to (892) 
[7633] day (803) 
[7634] had (448) 
[7635] nothing (597) 
[7636] in (359) 
[7637] the (744) 
[7638] house (219) 
[7639] more (592) 
[7640] precious (699) 
[7641] to (289) 
[7642] her (544) 
[7643] than (393) 
[7644] what (622) 
[7645] we (104) 
[7646] are (469) 
[7647] in (575) 
[7648] quest (705) 
[7649] of (24) 
[7650] She (336) 
[7651] would (83) 
[7652] rush (214) 
[7653] to (740) 
[7654] secure (800) 
[7655] it (472) 
[7656] The (313) 
[7657] alarm (291) 
[7658] of (860) 
[7659] fire (547) 
[7660] was (517) 
[7661] admirably (743) 
[7662] done (816) 
[7663] The (710) 
[7664] smoke (289) 
[7665] and (987) 
[7666] shouting (44) 
[7667] were (449) 
[7668] enough (230) 
[7669] to (782) 
[7670] shake (82) 
[7671] nerves (230) 
[7672] of (168) 
[7673] steel (365) 
[7674] She (869) 
[7675] responded (742) 
[7676] beautifully (230) 
[7677] The (67) 
[7678] photograph (66) 
[7679] is (647) 
[7680] in (78) 
[7681] a (494) 
[7682] recess (571) 
[7683] behind (25) 
[7684] a (595) 
[7685] sliding (840) 
[7686] panel (768) 
[7687] just (26) 
[7688] above (695) 
[7689] the (532) 
[7690] right (332) 
[7691] bell (105) 
[7692] pull (176) 
[7693] She (967) 
[7694] was (1) 
[7695] there (102) 
[7696] in (464) 
[7697] an (506) 
[7698] instant, (483) 
[7699] and (670) 
[7700] I (540) 
[7701] caught (739) 
[7702] a (728) 
[7703] glimpse (878) 
[7704] of (38) 
[7705] it (917) 
[7706] as (779) 
[7707] she (915) 
[7708] half (469) 
[7709] drew (415) 
[7710] it (581) 
[7711] out (541) 
[7712] When (178) 
[7713] I (292) 
[7714] cried (628) 
[7715] out (202) 
[7716] that (483) 
[7717] it (928) 
[7718] was (994) 
[7719] a (14) 
[7720] false (538) 
[7721] alarm, (447) 
[7722] she (29) 
[7723] replaced (34) 
[7724] it, (368) 
[7725] glanced (146) 
[7726] at (553) 
[7727] the (89) 
[7728] rocket, (681) 
[7729] rushed (465) 
[7730] from (493) 
[7731] the (990) 
[7732] room, (866) 
[7733] and (906) 
[7734] I (478) 
[7735] have (550) 
[7736] not (883) 
[7737] seen (847) 
[7738] her (69) 
[7739] since (302) 
[7740] I (601) 
[7741] rose, (90) 
[7742] and, (137) 
[7743] making (80) 
[7744] my (645) 
[7745] excuses, (573) 
[7746] escaped (76) 
[7747] from (913) 
[7748] the (269) 
[7749] house (261) 
[7750] I (153) 
[7751] hesitated (718) 
[7752] whether (89) 
[7753] to (331) 
[7754] attempt (387) 
[7755] to (825) 
[7756] secure (118) 
[7757] the (437) 
[7758] photograph (303) 
[7759] at (887) 
[7760] once; (96) 
[7761] but (919) 
[7762] the (410) 
[7763] coachman (105) 
[7764] had (268) 
[7765] come (413) 
[7766] in, (984) 
[7767] and (467) 
[7768] as (86) 
[7769] he (724) 
[7770] was (664) 
[7771] watching (867) 
[7772] me (377) 
[7773] narrowly, (297) 
[7774] it (549) 
[7775] seemed (861) 
[7776] safer (723) 
[7777] to (483) 
[7778] wait (650) 
[7779] A (637) 
[7780] little (744) 
[7781] over (973) 
[7782] precipitance (435) 
[7783] may (471) 
[7784] ruin (615) 
[7785] all (997) 
[7786] " (376) 
[7787] "And (537) 
[7788] now?" (490) 
[7789] I (818) 
[7790] asked (700) 
[7791] "Our (950) 
[7792] quest (457) 
[7793] is (704) 
[7794] practically (845) 
[7795] finished (760) 
[7796] I (520) 
[7797] shall (415) 
[7798] call (723) 
[7799] with (980) 
[7800] the (746) 
[7801] King (823) 
[7802] to (414) 
[7803] morrow, (105)

[7806] you, (703) 
[7807] if (938) 
[7808] you (855) 
[7809] care (667) 
[7810] to (686) 
[7811] come (161) 
[7812] with (134) 
[7813] us (510) 
[7814] We (8) 
[7815] will (254) 
[7816] be (62) 
[7817] shown (148) 
[7818] into (93) 
[7819] the (480) 
[7820] sitting (650) 
[7821] room (314)

[7824] for (959) 
[7825] the (639) 
[7826] lady, (130) 
[7827] but (186) 
[7828] it (950) 
[7829] is (975) 
[7830] probable (174) 
[7831] that (487) 
[7832] when (546) 
[7833] she (198) 
[7834] comes (390) 
[7835] she (515) 
[7836] may (498) 
[7837] find (445) 
[7838] neither (268) 
[7839] us (11) 
[7840] nor (723) 
[7841] the (530) 
[7842] photograph (91) 
[7843] It (44) 
[7844] might (716) 
[7845] be (164) 
[7846] a (492) 
[7847] satisfaction (573) 
[7848] to (636) 
[7849] his (708) 
[7850] Majesty (549) 
[7851] to (630) 
[7852] regain (545) 
[7853] it (221) 
[7854] with (410) 
[7855] his (710) 
[7856] own (775) 
[7857] hands (527)

[7859] "And (853) 
[7860] when (724) 
[7861] will (117) 
[7862] you (186) 
[7863] call?" (522) 
[7864] "At (907) 
[7865] eight (651) 
[7866] in (935) 
[7867] the (854) 
[7868] morning (194) 
[7869] She (531) 
[7870] will (322) 
[7871] not (289) 
[7872] be (905) 
[7873] up, (914) 
[7874] so (935) 
[7875] that (592) 
[7876] we (76) 
[7877] shall (130) 
[7878] have (48) 
[7879] a (298) 
[7880] clear (416) 
[7881] field (8) 
[7882] Besides, (99) 
[7883] we (757) 
[7884] must (617)

[7909] We (96) 
[7910] had (435) 
[7911] reached (786) 
[7912] Baker (583) 
[7913] Street (249) 
[7914] and (857) 
[7915] had (533) 
[7916] stopped (703) 
[7917] at (305) 
[7918] the (916) 
[7919] door (447) 
[7920] He (56) 
[7921] was (488) 
[7922] searching (737) 
[7923] his (73) 
[7924] pockets (942) 
[7925] for (741) 
[7926] the (331)

[7928] when (972) 
[7929] someone (448) 
[7930] passing (41) 
[7931] said (436) 
[7932] "Good (630) 
[7933] night, (960)

[7938] There (386) 
[7939] were (631)

[7948] but (967) 
[7949] the (646) 
[7950] greeting (614) 
[7951] appeared (968) 
[7952] to (962) 
[7953] come (128) 
[7954] from (391) 
[7955] a (46) 
[7956] slim (670) 
[7957] youth (647) 
[7958] in (679) 
[7959] an (519) 
[7960] ulster (645)

[7964] by (5)

[7969] voice (433) 
[7970] before," (81) 
[7971] said (745) 
[7972] Holmes, (598) 
[7973] staring (612) 
[7974] down (677) 
[7975] the (126) 
[7976] dimly (669) 
[7977] lit (672) 
[7978] street (59) 
[7979] "Now, (680)

[7999] we (746) 
[8000] were (347)

[8002] upon (562) 
[8003] our (31) 
[8004] toast (374)

[8006] coffee (674) 
[8007] in (346) 
[8008] the (963) 
[8009] morning (610)

[8011] the (887) 
[8012] King (954) 
[8013] of (219) 
[8014] Bohemia (906) 
[8015] rushed (507) 
[8016] into (623) 
[8017] the (740) 
[8018] room (611) 
[8019] "You (541) 
[8020] have (467) 
[8021] really (405) 
[8022] got (59) 
[8023] it (860) 
[8024] " (814) 
[8025] he (5) 
[8026] cried, (853) 
[8027] grasping (142) 
[8028] Sherlock (480)

[8030] by (987) 
[8031] either (116)

[8034] looking (848)

[8036] into (306) 
[8037] his (346) 
[8038] face (615)

[8197] a (925) 
[8198] moody (50) 
[8199] silence, (45)

[8201] was (832) 
[8202] not (914) 
[8203] broken (287) 
[8204] until (279) 
[8205] we (366) 
[8206] drew (68) 
[8207] up (627)

[8234] we (321) 
[8235] stepped (653) 
[8236] from (981)

[8250] answered (985) 
[8251] my (985) 
[8252] companion, (712) 
[8253] looking (182) 
[8254] at (258) 
[8255] her (363) 
[8256] with (541) 
[8257] a (765) 
[8258] questioning (524) 
[8259] and (145) 
[8260] rather (423) 
[8261] startled (786)

[8263] "Indeed (273)

[8294] " (973) 
[8295] Sherlock (20) 
[8296] Holmes (404) 
[8297] staggered (526) 
[8298] back, (814) 
[8299] white (964) 
[8300] with (721) 
[8301] chagrin (879) 
[8302] and (426) 
[8303] surprise (463) 
[8304] "Do (497) 
[8305] you (664) 
[8306] mean (355) 
[8307] that (915) 
[8308] she (114) 
[8309] has (840) 
[8310] left (911) 
[8311] England?" (103) 
[8312] "Never (767)

[8316] "And (259) 
[8317] the (857) 
[8318] papers?" (166) 
[8319] asked (592) 
[8320] the (540) 
[8321] King (155) 
[8322] hoarsely (393) 
[8323] "All (710) 
[8324] is (475) 
[8325] lost (525) 
[8326] " (226) 
[8327] "We (668) 
[8328] shall (686) 
[8329] see (623) 
[8330] " (878) 
[8331] He (198) 
[8332] pushed (306) 
[8333] past (866) 
[8334] the (750) 
[8335] servant (975) 
[8336] and (332) 
[8337] rushed (615) 
[8338] into (711) 
[8339] the (701) 
[8340] drawing (66) 
[8341] room, (621) 
[8342] followed (508) 
[8343] by (329) 
[8344] the (840) 
[8345] King (64) 
[8346] and (131) 
[8347] myself (158) 
[8348] The (910) 
[8349] furniture (170) 
[8350] was (477) 
[8351] scattered (778) 
[8352] about (510) 
[8353] in (656) 
[8354] every (836) 
[8355] direction, (94) 
[8356] with (470) 
[8357] dismantled (867) 
[8358] shelves (91) 
[8359] and (487) 
[8360] open (972) 
[8361] drawers, (859) 
[8362] as (510) 
[8363] if (939) 
[8364] the (145) 
[8365] lady (622) 
[8366] had (11) 
[8367] hurriedly (207) 
[8368] ransacked (616) 
[8369] them (836) 
[8370] before (873) 
[8371] her (910) 
[8372] flight (938) 
[8373] Holmes (591) 
[8374] rushed (269) 
[8375] at (533) 
[8376] the (569) 
[8377] bell (906) 
[8378] pull, (813) 
[8379] tore (148) 
[8380] back (713) 
[8381] a (434) 
[8382] small (446) 
[8383] sliding (520) 
[8384] shutter, (292) 
[8385] and, (534) 
[8386] plunging (786) 
[8387] in (693) 
[8388] his (721) 
[8389] hand, (762) 
[8390] pulled (529) 
[8391] out (252) 
[8392] a (821) 
[8393] photograph (39) 
[8394] and (668) 
[8395] a (958) 
[8396] letter (417) 
[8397] The (744) 
[8398] photograph (662) 
[8399] was (770) 
[8400] of (579) 
[8401] Irene (712) 
[8402] Adler (166) 
[8403] herself (420) 
[8404] in (417) 
[8405] evening (532) 
[8406] dress, (983) 
[8407] the (242) 
[8408] letter (652) 
[8409] was (754) 
[8410] superscribed (308) 
[8411] to (801) 
[8412] "Sherlock (922)

[8419] called (342)

[8422] My (215) 
[8423] friend (960) 
[8424] tore (312) 
[8425] it (782) 
[8426] open, (6) 
[8427] and (887) 
[8428] we (396) 
[8429] all (656) 
[8430] three (155) 
[8431] read (740) 
[8432] it (821) 
[8433] together (169) 
[8434] It (216) 
[8435] was (771)

[8439] of (228) 
[8440] the (791) 
[8441] preceding (602) 
[8442] night (269) 
[8443] and (693) 
[8444] ran (918) 
[8445] in (509) 
[8446] this (125) 
[8447] way (148) 
[8448] "MY (550) 
[8449] DEAR (156) 
[8450] MR (553) 
[8451] SHERLOCK (746) 
[8452] HOLMES, (646) 
[8453] You (965) 
[8454] really (975) 
[8455] did (922) 
[8456] it (647) 
[8457] very (195) 
[8458] well (536) 
[8459] You (48) 
[8460] took (252) 
[8461] me (762) 
[8462] in (814) 
[8463] completely (55) 
[8464] Until (597) 
[8465] after (702) 
[8466] the (474) 
[8467] alarm (643) 
[8468] of (460) 
[8469] fire, (611) 
[8470] I (901) 
[8471] had (597) 
[8472] not (456) 
[8473] a (536) 
[8474] suspicion (477) 
[8475] But (448) 
[8476] then, (252) 
[8477] when (891) 
[8478] I (676) 
[8479] found (153) 
[8480] how (573) 
[8481] I (960) 
[8482] had (905) 
[8483] betrayed (935) 
[8484] myself, (192) 
[8485] I (998) 
[8486] began (196) 
[8487] to (830) 
[8488] think (313) 
[8489] I (959) 
[8490] had (310) 
[8491] been (141) 
[8492] warned (650) 
[8493] against (172) 
[8494] you (517) 
[8495] months (242) 
[8496] ago (546) 
[8497] I (496) 
[8498] had (846) 
[8499] been (618) 
[8500] told (162) 
[8501] that, (661) 
[8502] if (83) 
[8503] the (146) 
[8504] King (274) 
[8505] employed (169) 
[8506] an (828) 
[8507] agent, (97) 
[8508] it (746) 
[8509] would (508) 
[8510] certainly (512) 
[8511] be (144) 
[8512] you (553) 
[8513] And (464) 
[8514] your (229) 
[8515] address (466) 
[8516] had (505) 
[8517] been (775) 
[8518] given (345) 
[8519] me (919) 
[8520] Yet, (207) 
[8521] with (716) 
[8522] all (203) 
[8523] this, (561) 
[8524] you (756) 
[8525] made (810) 
[8526] me (701) 
[8527] reveal (361) 
[8528] what (860) 
[8529] you (50) 
[8530] wanted (182) 
[8531] to (149) 
[8532] know (705) 
[8533] Even (850) 
[8534] after (245) 
[8535] I (71) 
[8536] became (370) 
[8537] suspicious, (901) 
[8538] I (750) 
[8539] found (79) 
[8540] it (260) 
[8541] hard (655) 
[8542] to (762) 
[8543] think (662) 
[8544] evil (659) 
[8545] of (953) 
[8546] such (952) 
[8547] a (379) 
[8548] dear, (719) 
[8549] kind (528) 
[8550] old (321) 
[8551] clergyman (685) 
[8552] But, (92) 
[8553] you (625) 
[8554] know, (896) 
[8555] I (763) 
[8556] have (38) 
[8557] been (606) 
[8558] trained (810) 
[8559] as (172) 
[8560] an (938) 
[8561] actress (55) 
[8562] myself (752) 
[8563] Male (689) 
[8564] costume (181) 
[8565] is (875) 
[8566] nothing (381) 
[8567] new (279) 
[8568] to (131) 
[8569] me (463) 
[8570] I (229) 
[8571] often (335) 
[8572] take (660) 
[8573] advantage (181) 
[8574] of (475) 
[8575] the (773) 
[8576] freedom (464) 
[8577] which (686) 
[8578] it (631) 
[8579] gives (997) 
[8580] I (359) 
[8581] sent (829) 
[8582] John, (545) 
[8583] the (741) 
[8584] coachman, (644) 
[8585] to (822) 
[8586] watch (149) 
[8587] you, (629) 
[8588] ran (293) 
[8589] upstairs, (316) 
[8590] got (235) 
[8591] into (663) 
[8592] my (344) 
[8593] walking (171) 
[8594] clothes, (84) 
[8595] as (485) 
[8596] I (920) 
[8597] call (396) 
[8598] them, (948) 
[8599] and (437) 
[8600] came (132) 
[8601] down (474) 
[8602] just (42) 
[8603] as (877) 
[8604] you (365) 
[8605] departed (206) 
[8606] "Well, (337) 
[8607] I (852) 
[8608] followed (18) 
[8609] you (206) 
[8610] to (241) 
[8611] your (29) 
[8612] door, (533) 
[8613] and (574) 
[8614] so (818) 
[8615] made (604) 
[8616] sure (447) 
[8617] that (499) 
[8618] I (802) 
[8619] was (583) 
[8620] really (101) 
[8621] an (88) 
[8622] object (871) 
[8623] of (944) 
[8624] interest (951) 
[8625] to (964) 
[8626] the (987) 
[8627] celebrated (619) 
[8628] Mr (563) 
[8629] Sherlock (96) 
[8630] Holmes (40) 
[8631] Then (830) 
[8632] I, (889) 
[8633] rather (74) 
[8634] imprudently, (165) 
[8635] wished (634) 
[8636] you (701) 
[8637] good (818) 
[8638] night, (912) 
[8639] and (563) 
[8640] started (706) 
[8641] for (778) 
[8642] the (452) 
[8643] Temple (683) 
[8644] to (274) 
[8645] see (81) 
[8646] my (275) 
[8647] husband (479) 
[8648] "We (135) 
[8649] both (297) 
[8650] thought (306) 
[8651] the (40) 
[8652] best (472) 
[8653] resource (34) 
[8654] was (811) 
[8655] flight, (824) 
[8656] when (59) 
[8657] pursued (823) 
[8658] by (884) 
[8659] so (12) 
[8660] formidable (706) 
[8661] an (424) 
[8662] antagonist; (562) 
[8663] so (293) 
[8664] you (114) 
[8665] will (876) 
[8666] find (691) 
[8667] the (644) 
[8668] nest (482) 
[8669] empty (33) 
[8670] when (894) 
[8671] you (916) 
[8672] call (249) 
[8673] to (124) 
[8674] morrow (603) 
[8675] As (424) 
[8676] to (431) 
[8677] the (435)

[9223] gentleman, (778) 
[9224] Mr (934) 
[9225] Wilson, (586) 
[9226] has (637) 
[9227] been (977) 
[9228] my (202) 
[9229] partner (561) 
[9230] and (966) 
[9231] helper (91) 
[9232] in (214) 
[9233] many (561) 
[9234] of (408) 
[9235] my (609) 
[9236] most (513) 
[9237] successful (953) 
[9238] cases, (438) 
[9239] and (186) 
[9240] I (265) 
[9241] have (831) 
[9242] no (245) 
[9243] doubt (504) 
[9244] that (461) 
[9245] he (878) 
[9246] will (216) 
[9247] be (298) 
[9248] of (422) 
[9249] the (159) 
[9250] utmost (565) 
[9251] use (226) 
[9252] to (368) 
[9253] me (630) 
[9254] in (256) 
[9255] yours (662) 
[9256] also (341) 
[9257] " (111) 
[9258] The (326) 
[9259] stout (235) 
[9260] gentleman (122) 
[9261] half (479) 
[9262] rose (769) 
[9263] from (523) 
[9264] his (88) 
[9265] chair (49) 
[9266] and (74) 
[9267] gave (574) 
[9268] a (532) 
[9269] bob (998) 
[9270] of (848) 
[9271] greeting, (587) 
[9272] with (280) 
[9273] a (553) 
[9274] quick (385) 
[9275] little (5) 
[9276] questioning (658) 
[9277] glance (757) 
[9278] from (534) 
[9279] his (681) 
[9280] small (589) 
[9281] fat (775) 
[9282] encircled (340) 
[9283] eyes (332) 
[9284] "Try (826) 
[9285] the (226) 
[9286] settee," (909) 
[9287] said (337) 
[9288] Holmes, (930) 
[9289] relapsing (448) 
[9290] into (525) 
[9291] his (448) 
[9292] armchair (639) 
[9293] and (557) 
[9294] putting (39) 
[9295] his (962) 
[9296] fingertips (262) 
[9297] together, (564) 
[9298] as (792) 
[9299] was (890) 
[9300] his (89) 
[9301] custom (591) 
[9302] when (550) 
[9303] in (590) 
[9304] judicial (236) 
[9305] moods (683) 
[9306] "I (728) 
[9307] know, (797) 
[9308] my (446) 
[9309] dear (934) 
[9310] Watson, (697) 
[9311] that (330) 
[9312] you (883) 
[9313] share (568) 
[9314] my (694) 
[9315] love (847) 
[9316] of (430) 
[9317] all (398) 
[9318] that (510) 
[9319] is (464) 
[9320] bizarre (470) 
[9321] and (544) 
[9322] outside (866) 
[9323] the (747) 
[9324] conventions (241) 
[9325] and (957) 
[9326] humdrum (364) 
[9327] routine (496) 
[9328] of (686) 
[9329] everyday (593) 
[9330] life (474) 
[9331] You (589) 
[9332] have (960) 
[9333] shown (680) 
[9334] your (884) 
[9335] relish (574) 
[9336] for (592) 
[9337] it (344) 
[9338] by (762) 
[9339] the (789) 
[9340] enthusiasm (348) 
[9341] which (447) 
[9342] has (832) 
[9343] prompted (589) 
[9344] you (577) 
[9345] to (333) 
[9346] chronicle, (168) 
[9347] and, (89) 
[9348] if (329) 
[9349] you (125) 
[9350] will (67) 
[9351] excuse (767) 
[9352] my (704) 
[9353] saying (876) 
[9354] so, (34) 
[9355] somewhat (140) 
[9356] to (379) 
[9357] embellish (542) 
[9358] so (849) 
[9359] many (112) 
[9360] of (6) 
[9361] my (447) 
[9362] own (297) 
[9363] little (649) 
[9364] adventures (927) 
[9365] " (795) 
[9366] "Your (618) 
[9367] cases (434) 
[9368] have (540) 
[9369] indeed (779) 
[9370] been (875) 
[9371] of (55) 
[9372] the (543) 
[9373] greatest (471) 
[9374] interest (557) 
[9375] to (916) 
[9376] me," (379) 
[9377] I (110) 
[9378] observed (926) 
[9379] "You (889) 
[9380] will (615) 
[9381] remember (822) 
[9382] that (693) 
[9383] I (589) 
[9384] remarked (886) 
[9385] the (340) 
[9386] other (298) 
[9387] day, (864) 
[9388] just (147) 
[9389] before (275) 
[9390] we (797) 
[9391] went (600) 
[9392] into (835) 
[9393] the (282) 
[9394] very (682) 
[9395] simple (25) 
[9396] problem (309) 
[9397] presented (987) 
[9398] by (517) 
[9399] Miss (967) 
[9400] Mary (477) 
[9401] Sutherland, (286) 
[9402] that (410) 
[9403] for (577) 
[9404] strange (248) 
[9405] effects (787) 
[9406] and (309) 
[9407] extraordinary (334) 
[9408] combinations (233) 
[9409] we (140) 
[9410] must (410) 
[9411] go (454) 
[9412] to (763) 
[9413] life (858) 
[9414] itself, (274) 
[9415] which (268) 
[9416] is (865) 
[9417] always (554) 
[9418] far (452) 
[9419] more (757) 
[9420] daring (101) 
[9421] than (198) 
[9422] any (42) 
[9423] effort (245) 
[9424] of (433) 
[9425] the (784) 
[9426] imagination (453) 
[9427] " (835) 
[9428] "A (396) 
[9429] proposition (178) 
[9430] which (441) 
[9431] I (176) 
[9432] took (298) 
[9433] the (607) 
[9434] liberty (92) 
[9435] of (84) 
[9436] doubting (927) 
[9437] " (682) 
[9438] "You (716)

[9442] none (173) 
[9443] the (974)

[9447] come (540) 
[9448] round (976) 
[9449] to (841) 
[9450] my (431) 
[9451] view, (945) 
[9452] for (747) 
[9453] otherwise (838) 
[9454] I (115) 
[9455] shall (515)

[9461] fact (794) 
[9462] on (530) 
[9463] you (244) 
[9464] until (749) 
[9465] your (364) 
[9466] reason (590) 
[9467] breaks (376) 
[9468] down (17) 
[9469] under (110) 
[9470] them (213) 
[9471] and (980) 
[9472] acknowledges (921) 
[9473] me (592) 
[9474] to (705) 
[9475] be (527)

[9477] Now, (232) 
[9478] Mr (960) 
[9479] Jabez (844) 
[9480] Wilson (962) 
[9481] here (462) 
[9482] has (38) 
[9483] been (168) 
[9484] good (480) 
[9485] enough (559) 
[9486] to (746) 
[9487] call (98) 
[9488] upon (998) 
[9489] me (771) 
[9490] this (625) 
[9491] morning, (500) 
[9492] and (56) 
[9493] to (159) 
[9494] begin (454) 
[9495] a (528) 
[9496] narrative (854) 
[9497] which (675) 
[9498] promises (679) 
[9499] to (766) 
[9500] be (414) 
[9501] one (889) 
[9502] of (742) 
[9503] the (123) 
[9504] most (39) 
[9505] singular (568) 
[9506] which (994) 
[9507] I (648) 
[9508] have (752) 
[9509] listened (667) 
[9510] to (776) 
[9511] for (767) 
[9512] some (601) 
[9513] time (327) 
[9514] You (649) 
[9515] have (514) 
[9516] heard (303) 
[9517] me (166) 
[9518] remark (562) 
[9519] that (662) 
[9520] the (21) 
[9521] strangest (675) 
[9522] and (500) 
[9523] most (748) 
[9524] unique (762) 
[9525] things (636) 
[9526] are (523) 
[9527] very (502) 
[9528] often (296) 
[9529] connected (765) 
[9530] not (443) 
[9531] with (829) 
[9532] the (770) 
[9533] larger (271) 
[9534] but (362) 
[9535] with (62) 
[9536] the (592) 
[9537] smaller (980) 
[9538] crimes, (406) 
[9539] and (688) 
[9540] occasionally, (472) 
[9541] indeed, (289) 
[9542] where (733) 
[9543] there (634) 
[9544] is (413) 
[9545] room (819) 
[9546] for (544) 
[9547] doubt (203) 
[9548] whether (610) 
[9549] any (391) 
[9550] positive (939) 
[9551] crime (86) 
[9552] has (753) 
[9553] been (619) 
[9554] committed (440) 
[9555] As (872) 
[9556] far (982) 
[9557] as (746) 
[9558] I (84) 
[9559] have (161) 
[9560] heard, (368) 
[9561] it (973) 
[9562] is (798) 
[9563] impossible (113) 
[9564] for (121) 
[9565] me (952) 
[9566] to (356) 
[9567] say (474) 
[9568] whether (671) 
[9569] the (152) 
[9570] present (767) 
[9571] case (342) 
[9572] is (352) 
[9573] an (1) 
[9574] instance (96) 
[9575] of (861) 
[9576] crime (327) 
[9577] or (382) 
[9578] not, (816) 
[9579] but (493) 
[9580] the (59) 
[9581] course (116) 
[9582] of (534) 
[9583] events (46) 
[9584] is (431) 
[9585] certainly (478) 
[9586] among (23) 
[9587] the (332) 
[9588] most (890) 
[9589] singular (193) 
[9590] that (7) 
[9591] I (396) 
[9592] have (340) 
[9593] ever (692) 
[9594] listened (607) 
[9595] to (741) 
[9596] Perhaps, (633) 
[9597] Mr (25) 
[9598] Wilson, (360) 
[9599] you (24) 
[9600] would (448) 
[9601] have (498) 
[9602] the (224) 
[9603] great (337) 
[9604] kindness (403) 
[9605] to (186) 
[9606] recommence (326) 
[9607] your (307) 
[9608] narrative (217) 
[9609] I (453) 
[9610] ask (526) 
[9611] you (124) 
[9612] not (444) 
[9613] merely (989) 
[9614] because (996) 
[9615] my (464) 
[9616] friend (381) 
[9617] Dr (759) 
[9618] Watson (621) 
[9619] has (360) 
[9620] not (965) 
[9621] heard (847) 
[9622] the (284) 
[9623] opening (728) 
[9624] part (279) 
[9625] but (296) 
[9626] also (447) 
[9627] because (484) 
[9628] the (53) 
[9629] peculiar (37) 
[9630] nature (146) 
[9631] of (357) 
[9632] the (486) 
[9633] story (0) 
[9634] makes (516) 
[9635] me (71) 
[9636] anxious (97) 
[9637] to (954) 
[9638] have (569) 
[9639] every (423) 
[9640] possible (848) 
[9641] detail (386) 
[9642] from (202) 
[9643] your (971) 
[9644] lips (776) 
[9645] As (526) 
[9646] a (604) 
[9647] rule, (13) 
[9648] when (890) 
[9649] I (346) 
[9650] have (976) 
[9651] heard (750) 
[9652] some (254) 
[9653] slight (482) 
[9654] indication (888) 
[9655] of (852) 
[9656] the (984) 
[9657] course (564) 
[9658] of (670) 
[9659] events, (615) 
[9660] I (394) 
[9661] am (20) 
[9662] able (575) 
[9663] to (542) 
[9664] guide (666) 
[9665] myself (900) 
[9666] by (269) 
[9667] the (63) 
[9668] thousands (894) 
[9669] of (971) 
[9670] other (150) 
[9671] similar (773) 
[9672] cases (175) 
[9673] which (422) 
[9674] occur (129) 
[9675] to (291) 
[9676] my (136) 
[9677] memory (73) 
[9678] In (223) 
[9679] the (425) 
[9680] present (962) 
[9681] instance (730) 
[9682] I (260) 
[9683] am (956) 
[9684] forced (849) 
[9685] to (674) 
[9686] admit (932) 
[9687] that (462) 
[9688] the (17) 
[9689] facts (221) 
[9690] are, (770) 
[9691] to (228) 
[9692] the (358) 
[9693] best (612) 
[9694] of (86) 
[9695] my (478) 
[9696] belief, (756) 
[9697] unique (586) 
[9698] " (141) 
[9699] The (240) 
[9700] portly (313) 
[9701] client (281) 
[9702] puffed (820) 
[9703] out (761) 
[9704] his (357) 
[9705] chest (155) 
[9706] with (925) 
[9707] an (624) 
[9708] appearance (164) 
[9709] of (500) 
[9710] some (503) 
[9711] little (305) 
[9712] pride (51) 
[9713] and (626) 
[9714] pulled (99) 
[9715] a (451)

[9725] his (960) 
[9726] greatcoat (666) 
[9727] As (220) 
[9728] he (999) 
[9729] glanced (921) 
[9730] down (618) 
[9731] the (311) 
[9732] advertisement (389) 
[9733] column, (996) 
[9734] with (401) 
[9735] his (511) 
[9736] head (170) 
[9737] thrust (655) 
[9738] forward (753) 
[9739] and (648) 
[9740] the (549) 
[9741] paper (725) 
[9742] flattened (216) 
[9743] out (582) 
[9744] upon (219) 
[9745] his (942) 
[9746] knee, (794)

[9749] a (306) 
[9750] good (140) 
[9751] look (890) 
[9752] at (519) 
[9753] the (967)

[9758] the (419)

[9760] of (486) 
[9761] my (86) 
[9762] companion, (811) 
[9763] to (649) 
[9764] read (940)

[11310] little (293) 
[11311] to (795) 
[11312] do (783) 
[11313] " (212) 
[11314] But, (128) 
[11315] said (876) 
[11316] I, (85) 
[11317] there (499) 
[11318] would (518) 
[11319] be (445) 
[11320] millions (230) 
[11321] of (528) 
[11322] red (55) 
[11323] headed (788) 
[11324] men (56) 
[11325] who (276) 
[11326] would (289) 
[11327] apply (493) 
[11328] " (837) 
[11329] Not (811) 
[11330] so (502) 
[11331] many (573) 
[11332] as (362) 
[11333] you (531) 
[11334] might (792) 
[11335] think, (392) 
[11336] he (799) 
[11337] answered (775) 
[11338] You (89) 
[11339] see (353) 
[11340] it (818) 
[11341] is (387) 
[11342] really (484) 
[11343] confined (946) 
[11344] to (444) 
[11345] Londoners, (892) 
[11346] and (825) 
[11347] to (396) 
[11348] grown (346) 
[11349] men (251) 
[11350] This (923) 
[11351] American (766) 
[11352] had (226) 
[11353] started (107) 
[11354] from (147) 
[11355] London (100) 
[11356] when (302) 
[11357] he (635) 
[11358] was (519) 
[11359] young, (380) 
[11360] and (132) 
[11361] he (293) 
[11362] wanted (355) 
[11363] to (491) 
[11364] do (294) 
[11365] the (150) 
[11366] old (494)

[11368] a (889) 
[11369] good (281) 
[11370] turn (667) 
[11371] Then, (61) 
[11372] again, (652) 
[11373] I (981) 
[11374] have (718) 
[11375] heard (549) 
[11376] it (767) 
[11377] is (119) 
[11378] no (94) 
[11379] use (862) 
[11380] your (301) 
[11381] applying (201) 
[11382] if (120) 
[11383] your (840) 
[11384] hair (135) 
[11385] is (430) 
[11386] light (559) 
[11387] red, (158) 
[11388] or (532) 
[11389] dark (520) 
[11390] red, (924) 
[11391] or (996) 
[11392] anything (143) 
[11393] but (438) 
[11394] real (782) 
[11395] bright, (276) 
[11396] blazing, (796) 
[11397] fiery (950) 
[11398] red (527) 
[11399] Now, (93) 
[11400] if (846) 
[11401] you (223) 
[11402] cared (820) 
[11403] to (846) 
[11404] apply, (395) 
[11405] Mr (71) 
[11406] Wilson, (591) 
[11407] you (378) 
[11408] would (244) 
[11409] just (492) 
[11410] walk (284) 
[11411] in; (793) 
[11412] but (489) 
[11413] perhaps (157) 
[11414] it (752) 
[11415] would (814) 
[11416] hardly (799) 
[11417] be (173) 
[11418] worth (735) 
[11419] your (555) 
[11420] while (154) 
[11421] to (30) 
[11422] put (684) 
[11423] yourself (800) 
[11424] out (111) 
[11425] of (242) 
[11426] the (718) 
[11427] way (603) 
[11428] for (874) 
[11429] the (606) 
[11430] sake (605) 
[11431] of (459) 
[11432] a (599) 
[11433] few (259) 
[11434] hundred (667) 
[11435] pounds (702) 
[11436] "Now, (446) 
[11437] it (234) 
[11438] is (606) 
[11439] a (41) 
[11440] fact, (607) 
[11441] gentlemen, (718) 
[11442] as (213) 
[11443] you (955) 
[11444] may (988) 
[11445] see (768) 
[11446] for (759) 
[11447] yourselves, (171) 
[11448] that (71) 
[11449] my (942) 
[11450] hair (20) 
[11451] is (720) 
[11452] of (189) 
[11453] a (134) 
[11454] very (407) 
[11455] full (647) 
[11456] and (842) 
[11457] rich (877) 
[11458] tint, (790) 
[11459] so (652) 
[11460] that (654) 
[11461] it (714) 
[11462] seemed (570) 
[11463] to (924) 
[11464] me (785) 
[11465] that (471) 
[11466] if (708) 
[11467] there (601) 
[11468] was (974) 
[11469] to (66) 
[11470] be (740) 
[11471] any (357) 
[11472] competition (284) 
[11473] in (908) 
[11474] the (194) 
[11475] matter (946) 
[11476] I (896) 
[11477] stood (990) 
[11478] as (673) 
[11479] good (863) 
[11480] a (812) 
[11481] chance (514) 
[11482] as (205) 
[11483] any (68) 
[11484] man (571) 
[11485] that (991) 
[11486] I (844) 
[11487] had (690) 
[11488] ever (951) 
[11489] met (498) 
[11490] Vincent (381) 
[11491] Spaulding (548) 
[11492] seemed (826) 
[11493] to (754) 
[11494] know (137) 
[11495] so (676) 
[11496] much (771) 
[11497] about (227) 
[11498] it (302) 
[11499] that (138) 
[11500] I (576) 
[11501] thought (318) 
[11502] he (662) 
[11503] might (639) 
[11504] prove (780) 
[11505] useful, (361) 
[11506] so (651) 
[11507] I (998) 
[11508] just (468) 
[11509] ordered (148) 
[11510] him (331) 
[11511] to (646) 
[11512] put (529) 
[11513] up (718) 
[11514] the (570) 
[11515] shutters (683) 
[11516] for (764) 
[11517] the (10) 
[11518] day (204) 
[11519] and (29) 
[11520] to (710) 
[11521] come (43) 
[11522] right (638) 
[11523] away (65) 
[11524] with (284) 
[11525] me (628) 
[11526] He (263) 
[11527] was (259) 
[11528] very (29) 
[11529] willing (974) 
[11530] to (261) 
[11531] have (979) 
[11532] a (822) 
[11533] holiday, (338) 
[11534] so (738) 
[11535] we (225) 
[11536] shut (12) 
[11537] the (501) 
[11538] business (941) 
[11539] up (32) 
[11540] and (626) 
[11541] started (642) 
[11542] off (670) 
[11543] for (101) 
[11544] the (812) 
[11545] address (558) 
[11546] that (858) 
[11547] was (390) 
[11548] given (711)

[11684] How (793) 
[11685] he (404)

[11687] it (742)

[11733] back (956) 
[11734] dejected; (234) 
[11735] but (619) 
[11736] we (916)

[11817] few (431) 
[11818] words (456) 
[11819] to (379) 
[11820] each (446) 
[11821] candidate (823) 
[11822] as (549) 
[11823] he (490) 
[11824] came (938) 
[11825] up, (361) 
[11826] and (104) 
[11827] then (810) 
[11828] he (276) 
[11829] always (86) 
[11830] managed (334) 
[11831] to (228) 
[11832] find (735) 
[11833] some (887) 
[11834] fault (697) 
[11835] in (122) 
[11836] them (624) 
[11837] which (192) 
[11838] would (638) 
[11839] disqualify (977) 
[11840] them (167) 
[11841] Getting (154) 
[11842] a (626) 
[11843] vacancy (346) 
[11844] did (561) 
[11845] not (839) 
[11846] seem (818) 
[11847] to (63) 
[11848] be (336) 
[11849] such (323) 
[11850] a (197) 
[11851] very (584) 
[11852] easy (590) 
[11853] matter, (200) 
[11854] after (416) 
[11855] all (902) 
[11856] However, (825) 
[11857] when (650) 
[11858] our (39) 
[11859] turn (897) 
[11860] came (528) 
[11861] the (582) 
[11862] little (374) 
[11863] man (180) 
[11864] was (563) 
[11865] much (446) 
[11866] more (238) 
[11867] favourable (222) 
[11868] to (944) 
[11869] me (355) 
[11870] than (846) 
[11871] to (141) 
[11872] any (716) 
[11873] of (786) 
[11874] the (343) 
[11875] others, (569) 
[11876] and (298) 
[11877] he (252) 
[11878] closed (824) 
[11879] the (851) 
[11880] door (261) 
[11881] as (777) 
[11882] we (217) 
[11883] entered, (962) 
[11884] so (193) 
[11885] that (545) 
[11886] he (802) 
[11887] might (510) 
[11888] have (323) 
[11889] a (560) 
[11890] private (508) 
[11891] word (846) 
[11892] with (230) 
[11893] us (647) 
[11894] " (178) 
[11895] This (330) 
[11896] is (526) 
[11897] Mr (61) 
[11898] Jabez (2) 
[11899] Wilson, (359) 
[11900] said (581) 
[11901] my (989) 
[11902] assistant, (581) 
[11903] and (191) 
[11904] he (649) 
[11905] is (55) 
[11906] willing (113) 
[11907] to (337) 
[11908] fill (100) 
[11909] a (143) 
[11910] vacancy (207) 
[11911] in (56) 
[11912] the (66) 
[11913] League (218) 
[11914] " (715) 
[11915] And (601) 
[11916] he (317) 
[11917] is (662) 
[11918] admirably (894) 
[11919] suited (111) 
[11920] for (549) 
[11921] it, (610) 
[11922] the (681) 
[11923] other (763) 
[11924] answered (592) 
[11925] He (725) 
[11926] has (354) 
[11927] every (380) 
[11928] requirement (574) 
[11929] I (481) 
[11930] cannot (915) 
[11931] recall (989) 
[11932] when (631) 
[11933] I (680) 
[11934] have (791) 
[11935] seen (663) 
[11936] anything (919) 
[11937] so (353) 
[11938] fine (614) 
[11939] He (524) 
[11940] took (87) 
[11941] a (790) 
[11942] step (488) 
[11943] backward, (527) 
[11944] cocked (416) 
[11945] his (162) 
[11946] head (602) 
[11947] on (974) 
[11948] one (124) 
[11949] side, (637) 
[11950] and (115) 
[11951] gazed (770) 
[11952] at (107) 
[11953] my (376) 
[11954] hair (599) 
[11955] until (615) 
[11956] I (300) 
[11957] felt (326) 
[11958] quite (56) 
[11959] bashful (870) 
[11960] Then (333) 
[11961] suddenly (284) 
[11962] he (577) 
[11963] plunged (291) 
[11964] forward, (724) 
[11965] wrung (305) 
[11966] my (585) 
[11967] hand, (892) 
[11968] and (195) 
[11969] congratulated (601) 
[11970] me (769) 
[11971] warmly (483) 
[11972] on (899) 
[11973] my (105) 
[11974] success (11) 
[11975] " (79) 
[11976] It (913) 
[11977] would (536) 
[11978] be (940) 
[11979] injustice (775) 
[11980] to (896) 
[11981] hesitate, (817) 
[11982] said (91) 
[11983] he (63) 
[11984] You (867) 
[11985] will, (821) 
[11986] however, (971) 
[11987] I (151) 
[11988] am (198) 
[11989] sure, (393) 
[11990] excuse (75) 
[11991] me (508) 
[11992] for (62) 
[11993] taking (407) 
[11994] an (154) 
[11995] obvious (121) 
[11996] precaution (479) 
[11997] With (912) 
[11998] that (677) 
[11999] he (826) 
[12000] seized (577) 
[12001] my (620) 
[12002] hair (936) 
[12003] in (974) 
[12004] both (255) 
[12005] his (176) 
[12006] hands, (416) 
[12007] and (210) 
[12008] tugged (414) 
[12009] until (539) 
[12010] I (761) 
[12011] yelled (780) 
[12012] with (522) 
[12013] the (167) 
[12014] pain (157) 
[12015] There (526) 
[12016] is (231) 
[12017] water (390) 
[12018] in (239) 
[12019] your (514) 
[12020] eyes, (551) 
[12021] said (639) 
[12022] he (943) 
[12023] as (985) 
[12024] he (255) 
[12025] released (835) 
[12026] me (550) 
[12027] I (456) 
[12028] perceive (152) 
[12029] that (119) 
[12030] all (524) 
[12031] is (408) 
[12032] as (392) 
[12033] it (650) 
[12034] should (681) 
[12035] be (778) 
[12036] But (170) 
[12037] we (456) 
[12038] have (169) 
[12039] to (994) 
[12040] be (189) 
[12041] careful, (589) 
[12042] for (209) 
[12043] we (952) 
[12044] have (374) 
[12045] twice (930) 
[12046] been (260) 
[12047] deceived (669) 
[12048] by (768) 
[12049] wigs (507) 
[12050] and (426) 
[12051] once (416) 
[12052] by (316) 
[12053] paint (987) 
[12054] I (585) 
[12055] could (69) 
[12056] tell (83) 
[12057] you (674) 
[12058] tales (210) 
[12059] of (548) 
[12060] cobbler (850) 
[12061] s (498) 
[12062] wax (643) 
[12063] which (353) 
[12064] would (708) 
[12065] disgust (958) 
[12066] you (883) 
[12067] with (514) 
[12068] human (583) 
[12069] nature (950) 
[12070] He (306) 
[12071] stepped (574) 
[12072] over (180) 
[12073] to (685) 
[12074] the (416) 
[12075] window (196) 
[12076] and (173) 
[12077] shouted (999) 
[12078] through (193) 
[12079] it (975) 
[12080] at (562) 
[12081] the (57) 
[12082] top (265) 
[12083] of (917) 
[12084] his (531) 
[12085] voice (737) 
[12086] that (622) 
[12087] the (152) 
[12088] vacancy (343) 
[12089] was (324) 
[12090] filled (512) 
[12091] A (809) 
[12092] groan (82) 
[12093] of (894) 
[12094] disappointment (29) 
[12095] came (415) 
[12096] up (989) 
[12097] from (457) 
[12098] below, (636) 
[12099] and (887) 
[12100] the (589) 
[12101] folk (30) 
[12102] all (351) 
[12103] trooped (659) 
[12104] away (565) 
[12105] in (861) 
[12106] different (428) 
[12107] directions (58) 
[12108] until (143) 
[12109] there (818) 
[12110] was (361) 
[12111] not (589) 
[12112] a (18) 
[12113] red (904) 
[12114] head (439) 
[12115] to (217)

[12119] my (634) 
[12120] own (722) 
[12121] and (639) 
[12122] that (558)

[12131] is (393) 
[12132] Mr (743) 
[12133] Duncan (105) 
[12134] Ross, (336) 
[12135] and (485) 
[12136] I (361) 
[12137] am (459) 
[12138] myself (96) 
[12139] one (200) 
[12140] of (692) 
[12141] the (584) 
[12142] pensioners (229)

[12144] the (281) 
[12145] fund (601) 
[12146] left (187) 
[12147] by (480) 
[12148] our (159) 
[12149] noble (446) 
[12150] benefactor (561) 
[12151] Are (287) 
[12152] you (953) 
[12153] a (779) 
[12154] married (790) 
[12155] man, (885) 
[12156] Mr (403) 
[12157] Wilson? (589) 
[12158] Have (635) 
[12159] you (329) 
[12160] a (20) 
[12161] family? (674) 
[12162] "I (705) 
[12163] answered (957) 
[12164] that (554) 
[12165] I (183) 
[12166] had (645) 
[12167] not (918)

[12173] Dear (615) 
[12174] me (256) 
[12175] he (696) 
[12176] said (356) 
[12177] gravely, (725) 
[12178] that (845) 
[12179] is (108) 
[12180] very (944) 
[12181] serious (781) 
[12182] indeed (53) 
[12183] I (464) 
[12184] am (649) 
[12185] sorry (625) 
[12186] to (197) 
[12187] hear (92) 
[12188] you (717) 
[12189] say (337) 
[12190] that (500) 
[12191] The (124) 
[12192] fund (745) 
[12193] was, (733) 
[12194] of (509) 
[12195] course, (311) 
[12196] for (464) 
[12197] the (781) 
[12198] propagation (895) 
[12199] and (332) 
[12200] spread (81) 
[12201] of (116)

[12203] red (787) 
[12204] heads (473) 
[12205] as (906) 
[12206] well (6) 
[12207] as (990) 
[12208] for (717) 
[12209] their (977) 
[12210] maintenance (834) 
[12211] It (672) 
[12212] is (696) 
[12213] exceedingly (861) 
[12214] unfortunate (631) 
[12215] that (718) 
[12216] you (941) 
[12217] should (378) 
[12218] be (133) 
[12219] a (125) 
[12220] bachelor (46) 
[12221] "My (385) 
[12222] face (58) 
[12223] lengthened (41) 
[12224] at (70) 
[12225] this, (816) 
[12226] Mr (611) 
[12227] Holmes, (984) 
[12228] for (660) 
[12229] I (37) 
[12230] thought (631) 
[12231] that (497) 
[12232] I (770) 
[12233] was (445) 
[12234] not (456) 
[12235] to (271) 
[12236] have (577) 
[12237] the (72) 
[12238] vacancy (558) 
[12239] after (320) 
[12240] all; (582) 
[12241] but (93) 
[12242] after (773) 
[12243] thinking (448) 
[12244] it (513) 
[12245] over (77) 
[12246] for (915) 
[12247] a (119) 
[12248] few (166) 
[12249] minutes (53) 
[12250] he (146) 
[12251] said (690) 
[12252] that (522) 
[12253] it (984) 
[12254] would (737) 
[12255] be (119) 
[12256] all (47) 
[12257] right (781) 
[12258] " (525) 
[12259] In (83) 
[12260] the (833) 
[12261] case (231) 
[12262] of (293) 
[12263] another, (47) 
[12264] said (878) 
[12265] he, (955) 
[12266] the (656) 
[12267] objection (48) 
[12268] might (45) 
[12269] be (283) 
[12270] fatal, (651) 
[12271] but (803) 
[12272] we (845) 
[12273] must (933) 
[12274] stretch (86) 
[12275] a (935) 
[12276] point (823) 
[12277] in (166) 
[12278] favour (38) 
[12279] of (402) 
[12280] a (72) 
[12281] man (676) 
[12282] with (114) 
[12283] such (480) 
[12284] a (696) 
[12285] head (523) 
[12286] of (741) 
[12287] hair (364) 
[12288] as (978) 
[12289] yours (959) 
[12290] When (122) 
[12291] shall (207) 
[12292] you (767) 
[12293] be (968) 
[12294] able (911) 
[12295] to (10) 
[12296] enter (398) 
[12297] upon (806) 
[12298] your (85) 
[12299] new (938) 
[12300] duties? (36) 
[12301] " (225) 
[12302] Well, (95) 
[12303] it (130) 
[12304] is (116) 
[12305] a (375) 
[12306] little (63) 
[12307] awkward, (732) 
[12308] for (663) 
[12309] I (489) 
[12310] have (142) 
[12311] a (844) 
[12312] business (685) 
[12313] already, (540) 
[12314] said (507) 
[12315] I (916)

[12317] Oh, (0) 
[12318] never (955)

[12661] the (458)

[12720] me (747) 
[12721] up, (524) 
[12722] but (246) 
[12723] by (510) 
[12724] bedtime (902) 
[12725] I (703) 
[12726] had (100) 
[12727] reasoned (547) 
[12728] myself (751) 
[12729] out (28) 
[12730] of (496)

[12735] in (5) 
[12736] the (280) 
[12737] morning (357) 
[12738] I (518) 
[12739] determined (556) 
[12740] to (51) 
[12741] have (229) 
[12742] a (220) 
[12743] look (396) 
[12744] at (775) 
[12745] it (683) 
[12746] anyhow, (624) 
[12747] so (790) 
[12748] I (675) 
[12749] bought (762) 
[12750] a (769) 
[12751] penny (468) 
[12752] bottle (709) 
[12753] of (169)

[12756] with (848) 
[12757] a (779)

[12760] and (545) 
[12761] seven (263)

[12763] of (247) 
[12764] foolscap (805)

[12766] I (595) 
[12767] started (974) 
[12768] off (382)

[12777] and (749) 
[12778] delight, (754) 
[12779] everything (485) 
[12780] was (520) 
[12781] as (276) 
[12782] right (882)

[12784] possible (200)

[14093] answered (740) 
[14094] "It (645)

[14143] black (758) 
[14144] clay (946)

[14146] thrusting (56) 
[14147] out (942)

[14164] dropped (108) 
[14165] asleep, (171)

[14890] we (142)

[14964] gently (850) 
[14965] waving (352) 
[14966] his (831) 
[14967] long, (693) 
[14968] thin (876) 
[14969] fingers (598) 
[14970] in (158)

[14981] his (946) 
[14982] languid, (712) 
[14983] dreamy (582) 
[14984] eyes (302) 
[14985] were (933) 
[14986] as (310) 
[14987] unlike (465) 
[14988] those (376) 
[14989] of (287) 
[14990] Holmes (428) 
[14991] the (872)

[15000] handed (250) 
[15001] criminal (719) 
[15002] agent, (747) 
[15003] as (32) 
[15004] it (56) 
[15005] was (389) 
[15006] possible (473) 
[15007] to (369) 
[15008] conceive (151) 
[15009] In (491) 
[15010] his (220) 
[15011] singular (347) 
[15012] character (474) 
[15013] the (966) 
[15014] dual (686) 
[15015] nature (199) 
[15016] alternately (201) 
[15017] asserted (761) 
[15018] itself, (375) 
[15019] and (605) 
[15020] his (349) 
[15021] extreme (107) 
[15022] exactness (906) 
[15023] and (352) 
[15024] astuteness (627) 
[15025] represented, (638) 
[15026] as (724) 
[15027] I (231) 
[15028] have (438) 
[15029] often (213) 
[15030] thought, (221) 
[15031] the (590) 
[15032] reaction (225) 
[15033] against (665) 
[15034] the (840) 
[15035] poetic (295) 
[15036] and (542) 
[15037] contemplative (426) 
[15038] mood (420) 
[15039] which (963) 
[15040] occasionally (329) 
[15041] predominated (961) 
[15042] in (563) 
[15043] him (646) 
[15044] The (85) 
[15045] swing (276) 
[15046] of (442) 
[15047] his (553) 
[15048] nature (465) 
[15049] took (245) 
[15050] him (309) 
[15051] from (146) 
[15052] extreme (571) 
[15053] languor (212) 
[15054] to (990) 
[15055] devouring (621) 
[15056] energy; (354) 
[15057] and, (932) 
[15058] as (13) 
[15059] I (494) 
[15060] knew (512) 
[15061] well, (169) 
[15062] he (634) 
[15063] was (128) 
[15064] never (673) 
[15065] so (982) 
[15066] truly (298) 
[15067] formidable (934) 
[15068] as (643) 
[15069] when, (145) 
[15070] for (555) 
[15071] days (942) 
[15072] on (230) 
[15073] end, (307) 
[15074] he (614) 
[15075] had (297) 
[15076] been (720) 
[15077] lounging (723) 
[15078] in (307) 
[15079] his (230) 
[15080] armchair (406) 
[15081] amid (687) 
[15082] his (804) 
[15083] improvisations (883) 
[15084] and (180) 
[15085] his (630) 
[15086] black (928) 
[15087] letter (377) 
[15088] editions (256) 
[15089] Then (47) 
[15090] it (475) 
[15091] was (904) 
[15092] that (898) 
[15093] the (475) 
[15094] lust (884) 
[15095] of (256) 
[15096] the (1) 
[15097] chase (26) 
[15098] would (825) 
[15099] suddenly (326) 
[15100] come (919) 
[15101] upon (516) 
[15102] him, (415) 
[15103] and (387) 
[15104] that (25) 
[15105] his (42) 
[15106] brilliant (491) 
[15107] reasoning (601) 
[15108] power (91) 
[15109] would (17) 
[15110] rise (289) 
[15111] to (104) 
[15112] the (974) 
[15113] level (110) 
[15114] of (896) 
[15115] intuition, (874) 
[15116] until (680) 
[15117] those (6) 
[15118] who (696) 
[15119] were (487) 
[15120] unacquainted (249) 
[15121] with (738) 
[15122] his (372) 
[15123] methods (430) 
[15124] would (736) 
[15125] look (156) 
[15126] askance (401) 
[15127] at (850) 
[15128] him (355) 
[15129] as (33) 
[15130] on (134) 
[15131] a (395) 
[15132] man (380) 
[15133] whose (162) 
[15134] knowledge (397) 
[15135] was (172) 
[15136] not (242) 
[15137] that (936) 
[15138] of (621) 
[15139] other (164) 
[15140] mortals (556) 
[15141] When (906) 
[15142] I (850) 
[15143] saw (245) 
[15144] him (90) 
[15145] that (601) 
[15146] afternoon (87) 
[15147] so (299) 
[15148] enwrapped (398) 
[15149] in (143) 
[15150] the (928) 
[15151] music (356) 
[15152] at (476)

[15154] James (418) 
[15155] s (193) 
[15156] Hall (753) 
[15157] I (918) 
[15158] felt (640) 
[15159] that (500) 
[15160] an (950) 
[15161] evil (127) 
[15162] time (26) 
[15163] might (311) 
[15164] be (768) 
[15165] coming (218) 
[15166] upon (840) 
[15167] those (988) 
[15168] whom (335) 
[15169] he (771) 
[15170] had (660) 
[15171] set (894) 
[15172] himself (292) 
[15173] to (976)

[15184] he (974)

[15381] the (754) 
[15382] whole (855) 
[15383] business (294) 
[15384] was (178) 
[15385] still (872) 
[15386] confused (343) 
[15387] and (704) 
[15388] grotesque (332) 
[15389] As (965) 
[15390] I (940)

[15400] over (112) 
[15401] it (331) 
[15402] all, (476) 
[15403] from (588) 
[15404] the (274) 
[15405] extraordinary (821) 
[15406] story (13) 
[15407] of (973)

[15419] to (661) 
[15420] Saxe (579) 
[15421] Coburg (233) 
[15422] Square, (281) 
[15423] and (885) 
[15424] the (239) 
[15425] ominous (408) 
[15426] words (281) 
[15427] with (947) 
[15428] which (274) 
[15429] he (191) 
[15430] had (463) 
[15431] parted (265) 
[15432] from (45) 
[15433] me (242) 
[15434] What (177) 
[15435] was (301) 
[15436] this (864) 
[15437] nocturnal (856) 
[15438] expedition, (120) 
[15439] and (224) 
[15440] why (116) 
[15441] should (221) 
[15442] I (558) 
[15443] go (466) 
[15444] armed? (665) 
[15445] Where (498) 
[15446] were (863) 
[15447] we (358) 
[15448] going, (274) 
[15449] and (908) 
[15450] what (910) 
[15451] were (24) 
[15452] we (501) 
[15453] to (242) 
[15454] do? (362) 
[15455] I (141) 
[15456] had (392) 
[15457] the (969) 
[15458] hint (316) 
[15459] from (742) 
[15460] Holmes (259) 
[15461] that (557) 
[15462] this (806)

[15465] pawnbroker (275) 
[15466] s (94) 
[15467] assistant (55) 
[15468] was (937) 
[15469] a (808) 
[15470] formidable (589) 
[15471] man (696) 
[15472] a (805) 
[15473] man (627) 
[15474] who (73) 
[15475] might (411) 
[15476] play (46) 
[15477] a (632) 
[15478] deep (484) 
[15479] game (531) 
[15480] I (900) 
[15481] tried (723) 
[15482] to (833) 
[15483] puzzle (749) 
[15484] it (243) 
[15485] out, (23) 
[15486] but (194) 
[15487] gave (716) 
[15488] it (574) 
[15489] up (122) 
[15490] in (217) 
[15491] despair (768) 
[15492] and (857) 
[15493] set (880) 
[15494] the (386) 
[15495] matter (663) 
[15496] aside (956) 
[15497] until (142) 
[15498] night (341) 
[15499] should (800) 
[15500] bring (248) 
[15501] an (193) 
[15502] explanation (691) 
[15503] It (773) 
[15504] was (426) 
[15505] a (332) 
[15506] quarter (625) 
[15507] past (780) 
[15508] nine (880) 
[15509] when (309) 
[15510] I (449) 
[15511] started (631) 
[15512] from (866) 
[15513] home (289) 
[15514] and (738) 
[15515] made (68) 
[15516] my (21) 
[15517] way (336) 
[15518] across (308) 
[15519] the (66) 
[15520] Park, (7) 
[15521] and (862) 
[15522] so (837) 
[15523] through (872) 
[15524] Oxford (604) 
[15525] Street (280) 
[15526] to (777)

[15528] Street (120) 
[15529] Two (688) 
[15530] hansoms (310) 
[15531] were (311) 
[15532] standing (465) 
[15533] at (151) 
[15534] the (882) 
[15535] door, (962) 
[15536] and (544) 
[15537] as (202) 
[15538] I (25) 
[15539] entered (60) 
[15540] the (936)

[15542] I (295) 
[15543] heard (276) 
[15544] the (846)

[15546] of (130) 
[15547] voices (355) 
[15548] from (325) 
[15549] above (951) 
[15550] On (610) 
[15551] entering (583) 
[15552] his (604) 
[15553] room, (921) 
[15554] I (833) 
[15555] found (309)

[15564] of (199) 
[15565] whom (790) 
[15566] I (121) 
[15567] recognised (408)

[15581] thin, (585) 
[15582] sad (949)

[16420] solemn (379) 
[16421] Mr (119) 
[16422] Merryweather (577) 
[16423] perched (834) 
[16424] himself (59) 
[16425] upon (469) 
[16426] a (493) 
[16427] crate, (115) 
[16428] with (892) 
[16429] a (146) 
[16430] very (798) 
[16431] injured (347) 
[16432] expression (915) 
[16433] upon (18) 
[16434] his (762) 
[16435] face, (326) 
[16436] while (255) 
[16437] Holmes (660) 
[16438] fell (985) 
[16439] upon (759) 
[16440] his (760)

[16450] a (680) 
[16451] magnifying (795) 
[16452] lens, (136)

[16462] A (110) 
[16463] few (74) 
[16464] seconds (316) 
[16465] sufficed (979) 
[16466] to (371) 
[16467] satisfy (589) 
[16468] him, (624) 
[16469] for (757)

[16471] sprang (563)

[16475] again (672)

[16904] in (468) 
[16905] pitch (381) 
[16906] darkness (825) 
[16907] such (672) 
[16908] an (121) 
[16909] absolute (608) 
[16910] darkness (564) 
[16911] as (644) 
[16912] I (581) 
[16913] have (950) 
[16914] never (734) 
[16915] before (992) 
[16916] experienced (82) 
[16917] The (263) 
[16918] smell (47) 
[16919] of (500) 
[16920] hot (960) 
[16921] metal (290) 
[16922] remained (745) 
[16923] to (698) 
[16924] assure (173) 
[16925] us (446) 
[16926] that (584) 
[16927] the (121) 
[16928] light (682) 
[16929] was (218) 
[16930] still (947) 
[16931] there, (690) 
[16932] ready (857) 
[16933] to (143) 
[16934] flash (624) 
[16935] out (268) 
[16936] at (109) 
[16937] a (556) 
[16938] moment (225) 
[16939] s (702) 
[16940] notice (270) 
[16941] To (620) 
[16942] me, (647) 
[16943] with (725) 
[16944] my (505) 
[16945] nerves (266) 
[16946] worked (208) 
[16947] up (383) 
[16948] to (737) 
[16949] a (45) 
[16950] pitch (694) 
[16951] of (824) 
[16952] expectancy, (933) 
[16953] there (335) 
[16954] was (239) 
[16955] something (956) 
[16956] depressing (959) 
[16957] and (438) 
[16958] subduing (219) 
[16959] in (54) 
[16960] the (898) 
[16961] sudden (975) 
[16962] gloom, (902) 
[16963] and (781) 
[16964] in (53) 
[16965] the (130) 
[16966] cold (192) 
[16967] dank (148) 
[16968] air (160) 
[16969] of (410) 
[16970] the (111) 
[16971] vault (877)

[16977] whispered (411) 
[16978] Holmes (517) 
[16979] "That (218)

[17021] now (246)

[17037] afterwards (917) 
[17038] it (76)

[17047] it (811)

[17051] that (857) 
[17052] the (500)

[17065] My (575) 
[17066] limbs (817) 
[17067] were (224) 
[17068] weary (43) 
[17069] and (253) 
[17070] stiff, (655) 
[17071] for (877) 
[17072] I (266) 
[17073] feared (355) 
[17074] to (480) 
[17075] change (562) 
[17076] my (484) 
[17077] position; (203) 
[17078] yet (735) 
[17079] my (983)

[17083] up (782) 
[17084] to (231) 
[17085] the (970) 
[17086] highest (628) 
[17087] pitch (386) 
[17088] of (512) 
[17089] tension, (103) 
[17090] and (688) 
[17091] my (235) 
[17092] hearing (810) 
[17093] was (417) 
[17094] so (896) 
[17095] acute (452) 
[17096] that (33) 
[17097] I (531) 
[17098] could (372) 
[17099] not (316) 
[17100] only (179) 
[17101] hear (62) 
[17102] the (310) 
[17103] gentle (525) 
[17104] breathing (865) 
[17105] of (497) 
[17106] my (129) 
[17107] companions, (261) 
[17108] but (928) 
[17109] I (904) 
[17110] could (191) 
[17111] distinguish (764) 
[17112] the (389) 
[17113] deeper, (232) 
[17114] heavier (48) 
[17115] in (898) 
[17116] breath (392) 
[17117] of (457) 
[17118] the (335) 
[17119] bulky (73) 
[17120] Jones (425) 
[17121] from (140) 
[17122] the (819) 
[17123] thin, (587) 
[17124] sighing (788) 
[17125] note (816) 
[17126] of (168) 
[17127] the (821) 
[17128] bank (634) 
[17129] director (667) 
[17130] From (855) 
[17131] my (997) 
[17132] position (910) 
[17133] I (263) 
[17134] could (832) 
[17135] look (363) 
[17136] over (417) 
[17137] the (566) 
[17138] case (673) 
[17139] in (356) 
[17140] the (302) 
[17141] direction (663) 
[17142] of (898) 
[17143] the (358) 
[17144] floor (953) 
[17145] Suddenly (444) 
[17146] my (386) 
[17147] eyes (160) 
[17148] caught (528) 
[17149] the (510) 
[17150] glint (278) 
[17151] of (358) 
[17152] a (237) 
[17153] light (230) 
[17154] At (462) 
[17155] first (303) 
[17156] it (962) 
[17157] was (482) 
[17158] but (527) 
[17159] a (537) 
[17160] lurid (648) 
[17161] spark (331) 
[17162] upon (143) 
[17163] the (340) 
[17164] stone (859) 
[17165] pavement (498) 
[17166] Then (681) 
[17167] it (464) 
[17168] lengthened (187) 
[17169] out (598) 
[17170] until (854) 
[17171] it (570) 
[17172] became (291) 
[17173] a (336) 
[17174] yellow (356) 
[17175] line, (729) 
[17176] and (867) 
[17177] then, (869) 
[17178] without (43) 
[17179] any (116) 
[17180] warning (317) 
[17181] or (900) 
[17182] sound, (184) 
[17183] a (721) 
[17184] gash (423) 
[17185] seemed (450) 
[17186] to (625) 
[17187] open (266) 
[17188] and (437) 
[17189] a (695) 
[17190] hand (901) 
[17191] appeared, (91) 
[17192] a (680) 
[17193] white, (671) 
[17194] almost (183) 
[17195] womanly (494) 
[17196] hand, (534) 
[17197] which (138) 
[17198] felt (648) 
[17199] about (907) 
[17200] in (521) 
[17201] the (800) 
[17202] centre (864) 
[17203] of (169) 
[17204] the (892) 
[17205] little (336) 
[17206] area (482) 
[17207] of (424) 
[17208] light (676) 
[17209] For (888) 
[17210] a (624) 
[17211] minute (489) 
[17212] or (826) 
[17213] more (384) 
[17214] the (88) 
[17215] hand, (631) 
[17216] with (813) 
[17217] its (577) 
[17218] writhing (240) 
[17219] fingers, (461) 
[17220] protruded (13) 
[17221] out (314) 
[17222] of (594) 
[17223] the (606) 
[17224] floor (561) 
[17225] Then (768) 
[17226] it (240) 
[17227] was (47) 
[17228] withdrawn (631) 
[17229] as (763) 
[17230] suddenly (686) 
[17231] as (970) 
[17232] it (341) 
[17233] appeared, (997) 
[17234] and (48) 
[17235] all (706) 
[17236] was (515) 
[17237] dark (511) 
[17238] again (26) 
[17239] save (222) 
[17240] the (605) 
[17241] single (684) 
[17242] lurid (716) 
[17243] spark (495) 
[17244] which (309) 
[17245] marked (141) 
[17246] a (493) 
[17247] chink (546) 
[17248] between (210) 
[17249] the (291) 
[17250] stones (501) 
[17251] Its (630) 
[17252] disappearance, (886) 
[17253] however, (309) 
[17254] was (786) 
[17255] but (975) 
[17256] momentary (141) 
[17257] With (790) 
[17258] a (916) 
[17259] rending, (487) 
[17260] tearing (142) 
[17261] sound, (990) 
[17262] one (964) 
[17263] of (717) 
[17264] the (757) 
[17265] broad, (384) 
[17266] white (19) 
[17267] stones (134) 
[17268] turned (580) 
[17269] over (889) 
[17270] upon (106) 
[17271] its (287) 
[17272] side (458) 
[17273] and (377) 
[17274] left (51) 
[17275] a (250) 
[17276] square, (839) 
[17277] gaping (482) 
[17278] hole, (240) 
[17279] through (811) 
[17280] which (530) 
[17281] streamed (963) 
[17282] the (680) 
[17283] light (832) 
[17284] of (877) 
[17285] a (433) 
[17286] lantern (782) 
[17287] Over (776) 
[17288] the (935) 
[17289] edge (312) 
[17290] there (288) 
[17291] peeped (341) 
[17292] a (73) 
[17293] clean (918) 
[17294] cut, (178) 
[17295] boyish (874) 
[17296] face, (534) 
[17297] which (901) 
[17298] looked (195) 
[17299] keenly (787) 
[17300] about (19) 
[17301] it, (473) 
[17302] and (855) 
[17303] then, (662) 
[17304] with (975) 
[17305] a (414) 
[17306] hand (724) 
[17307] on (337) 
[17308] either (905) 
[17309] side (527) 
[17310] of (969) 
[17311] the (764) 
[17312] aperture, (799) 
[17313] drew (127) 
[17314] itself (289) 
[17315] shoulder (100) 
[17316] high (149) 
[17317] and (286) 
[17318] waist (453) 
[17319] high, (84) 
[17320] until (928) 
[17321] one (379) 
[17322] knee (842) 
[17323] rested (723) 
[17324] upon (659) 
[17325] the (265) 
[17326] edge (133) 
[17327] In (66) 
[17328] another (175) 
[17329] instant (620) 
[17330] he (266) 
[17331] stood (941) 
[17332] at (867) 
[17333] the (423) 
[17334] side (361) 
[17335] of (646) 
[17336] the (966) 
[17337] hole (311) 
[17338] and (962) 
[17339] was (298) 
[17340] hauling (877) 
[17341] after (492) 
[17342] him (653) 
[17343] a (541) 
[17344] companion, (727) 
[17345] lithe (412) 
[17346] and (138) 
[17347] small (734) 
[17348] like (323) 
[17349] himself, (256) 
[17350] with (872) 
[17351] a (600) 
[17352] pale (203) 
[17353] face (100) 
[17354] and (88) 
[17355] a (387) 
[17356] shock (822) 
[17357] of (203) 
[17358] very (705) 
[17359] red (675)

[17361] "It (353) 
[17362] s (336) 
[17363] all (821) 
[17364] clear," (806) 
[17365] he (375) 
[17366] whispered (279) 
[17367] "Have (741) 
[17368] you (626) 
[17369] the (859)

[17386] Sherlock (907)

[17388] had (590) 
[17389] sprung (756) 
[17390] out (430)

[17392] seized (534)

[17401] down (572) 
[17402] the (620) 
[17403] hole, (654) 
[17404] and (7) 
[17405] I (131) 
[17406] heard (34) 
[17407] the (491) 
[17408] sound (395) 
[17409] of (840)

[17920] it (833) 
[17921] to (817) 
[17922] them, (183) 
[17923] who (134) 
[17924] were (180) 
[17925] playing (73) 
[17926] for (583) 
[17927] thousands? (619) 
[17928] They (938) 
[17929] put (545) 
[17930] in (985) 
[17931] the (166) 
[17932] advertisement, (979) 
[17933] one (114) 
[17934] rogue (74) 
[17935] has (576) 
[17936] the (142) 
[17937] temporary (451) 
[17938] office, (284) 
[17939] the (388) 
[17940] other (618) 
[17941] rogue (879) 
[17942] incites (356) 
[17943] the (316) 
[17944] man (798) 
[17945] to (109) 
[17946] apply (230) 
[17947] for (567) 
[17948] it, (257) 
[17949] and (339) 
[17950] together (788) 
[17951] they (457) 
[17952] manage (474) 
[17953] to (349) 
[17954] secure (503) 
[17955] his (330) 
[17956] absence (879) 
[17957] every (582) 
[17958] morning (618) 
[17959] in (655) 
[17960] the (944) 
[17961] week (64) 
[17962] From (215) 
[17963] the (21) 
[17964] time (768) 
[17965] that (34) 
[17966] I (963) 
[17967] heard (92) 
[17968] of (865) 
[17969] the (164) 
[17970] assistant (320) 
[17971] having (147) 
[17972] come (986) 
[17973] for (139) 
[17974] half (802) 
[17975] wages, (40) 
[17976] it (368) 
[17977] was (544) 
[17978] obvious (215) 
[17979] to (981) 
[17980] me (442) 
[17981] that (210) 
[17982] he (189) 
[17983] had (902) 
[17984] some (802) 
[17985] strong (441) 
[17986] motive (924) 
[17987] for (215) 
[17988] securing (407) 
[17989] the (669) 
[17990] situation (962) 
[17991] " (284) 
[17992] "But (801) 
[17993] how (311) 
[17994] could (67) 
[17995] you (147) 
[17996] guess (396) 
[17997] what (571) 
[17998] the (289) 
[17999] motive (790) 
[18000] was?" (244) 
[18001] "Had (306) 
[18002] there (252) 
[18003] been (8) 
[18004] women (963) 
[18005] in (859) 
[18006] the (302) 
[18007] house, (273) 
[18008] I (378) 
[18009] should (576) 
[18010] have (484) 
[18011] suspected (918) 
[18012] a (635) 
[18013] mere (951) 
[18014] vulgar (992) 
[18015] intrigue (119) 
[18016] That, (649) 
[18017] however, (817) 
[18018] was (499) 
[18019] out (762) 
[18020] of (13) 
[18021] the (585)

[18029] small (42) 
[18030] one, (741) 
[18031] and (569) 
[18032] there (862) 
[18033] was (454) 
[18034] nothing (508) 
[18035] in (403) 
[18036] his (367) 
[18037] house (389) 
[18038] which (303) 
[18039] could (380) 
[18040] account (460) 
[18041] for (926) 
[18042] such (185) 
[18043] elaborate (966) 
[18044] preparations, (54) 
[18045] and (466) 
[18046] such (777)

[18049] as (492) 
[18050] they (532) 
[18051] were (851) 
[18052] at (39) 
[18053] It (663) 
[18054] must, (697) 
[18055] then, (341) 
[18056] be (435) 
[18057] something (116) 
[18058] out (247) 
[18059] of (187) 
[18060] the (592) 
[18061] house (552) 
[18062] What (725) 
[18063] could (804) 
[18064] it (282) 
[18065] be? (320) 
[18066] I (903) 
[18067] thought (717) 
[18068] of (721) 
[18069] the (578) 
[18070] assistant (282) 
[18071] s (183) 
[18072] fondness (260) 
[18073] for (721) 
[18074] photography, (922) 
[18075] and (383) 
[18076] his (819) 
[18077] trick (780) 
[18078] of (429) 
[18079] vanishing (354) 
[18080] into (692) 
[18081] the (642) 
[18082] cellar (810) 
[18083] The (791) 
[18084] cellar (103) 
[18085] There (584) 
[18086] was (949) 
[18087] the (147) 
[18088] end (634) 
[18089] of (381) 
[18090] this (603) 
[18091] tangled (557) 
[18092] clue (130) 
[18093] Then (518) 
[18094] I (262) 
[18095] made (109) 
[18096] inquiries (53) 
[18097] as (994) 
[18098] to (396) 
[18099] this (513) 
[18100] mysterious (800) 
[18101] assistant (266) 
[18102] and (374) 
[18103] found (774) 
[18104] that (192) 
[18105] I (702) 
[18106] had (228) 
[18107] to (465) 
[18108] deal (979) 
[18109] with (306) 
[18110] one (397) 
[18111] of (819) 
[18112] the (942) 
[18113] coolest (779) 
[18114] and (476) 
[18115] most (261) 
[18116] daring (4) 
[18117] criminals (25) 
[18118] in (21) 
[18119] London (303) 
[18120] He (387) 
[18121] was (448) 
[18122] doing (228) 
[18123] something (419) 
[18124] in (123) 
[18125] the (910) 
[18126] cellar (908) 
[18127] something (518) 
[18128] which (583) 
[18129] took (87) 
[18130] many (529) 
[18131] hours (820) 
[18132] a (657) 
[18133] day (632) 
[18134] for (838) 
[18135] months (408) 
[18136] on (189) 
[18137] end (195) 
[18138] What (17) 
[18139] could (847) 
[18140] it (468) 
[18141] be, (104) 
[18142] once (633) 
[18143] more? (282) 
[18144] I (603) 
[18145] could (164) 
[18146] think (659) 
[18147] of (416) 
[18148] nothing (964) 
[18149] save (820) 
[18150] that (634) 
[18151] he (474) 
[18152] was (191) 
[18153] running (783) 
[18154] a (757) 
[18155] tunnel (935) 
[18156] to (825) 
[18157] some (958) 
[18158] other (8) 
[18159] building (121) 
[18160] "So (532) 
[18161] far (514) 
[18162] I (40) 
[18163] had (867) 
[18164] got (336) 
[18165] when (512) 
[18166] we (188) 
[18167] went (945) 
[18168] to (554) 
[18169] visit (882) 
[18170] the (0) 
[18171] scene (473) 
[18172] of (811) 
[18173] action (735) 
[18174] I (19) 
[18175] surprised (845) 
[18176] you (887) 
[18177] by (912) 
[18178] beating (703) 
[18179] upon (799) 
[18180] the (976) 
[18181] pavement (782) 
[18182] with (292) 
[18183] my (990) 
[18184] stick (134) 
[18185] I (46) 
[18186] was (8) 
[18187] ascertaining (584) 
[18188] whether (797) 
[18189] the (632) 
[18190] cellar (173) 
[18191] stretched (300) 
[18192] out (73) 
[18193] in (769) 
[18194] front (238) 
[18195] or (535) 
[18196] behind (473) 
[18197] It (279) 
[18198] was (312) 
[18199] not (72) 
[18200] in (120) 
[18201] front (684) 
[18202] Then (742) 
[18203] I (655) 
[18204] rang (533) 
[18205] the (388) 
[18206] bell, (544) 
[18207] and, (882) 
[18208] as (916) 
[18209] I (738) 
[18210] hoped, (779) 
[18211] the (377) 
[18212] assistant (480) 
[18213] answered (810) 
[18214] it (681) 
[18215] We (942) 
[18216] have (507) 
[18217] had (181) 
[18218] some (218) 
[18219] skirmishes, (606) 
[18220] but (116) 
[18221] we (805) 
[18222] had (350) 
[18223] never (659) 
[18224] set (29) 
[18225] eyes (32) 
[18226] upon (278) 
[18227] each (719) 
[18228] other (841) 
[18229] before (312) 
[18230] I (527) 
[18231] hardly (991) 
[18232] looked (181) 
[18233] at (104) 
[18234] his (266) 
[18235] face (398) 
[18236] His (732) 
[18237] knees (135) 
[18238] were (253) 
[18239] what (945) 
[18240] I (354) 
[18241] wished (617) 
[18242] to (488) 
[18243] see (998) 
[18244] You (408) 
[18245] must (203) 
[18246] yourself (617) 
[18247] have (233) 
[18248] remarked (736) 
[18249] how (777) 
[18250] worn, (624) 
[18251] wrinkled, (851) 
[18252] and (490) 
[18253] stained (769) 
[18254] they (897) 
[18255] were (535) 
[18256] They (496) 
[18257] spoke (930) 
[18258] of (335) 
[18259] those (562) 
[18260] hours (9) 
[18261] of (726) 
[18262] burrowing (473) 
[18263] The (770) 
[18264] only (604) 
[18265] remaining (331) 
[18266] point (220) 
[18267] was (754) 
[18268] what (719) 
[18269] they (124) 
[18270] were (967) 
[18271] burrowing (62) 
[18272] for (368) 
[18273] I (362) 
[18274] walked (461) 
[18275] round (258) 
[18276] the (800) 
[18277] corner, (899) 
[18278] saw (713) 
[18279] the (728) 
[18280] City (732) 
[18281] and (358) 
[18282] Suburban (796) 
[18283] Bank (93) 
[18284] abutted (241) 
[18285] on (334) 
[18286] our (367) 
[18287] friend (839) 
[18288] s (319) 
[18289] premises, (671) 
[18290] and (61) 
[18291] felt (910) 
[18292] that (726) 
[18293] I (743) 
[18294] had (299) 
[18295] solved (138) 
[18296] my (497) 
[18297] problem (980) 
[18298] When (271) 
[18299] you (289) 
[18300] drove (875) 
[18301] home (971) 
[18302] after (55) 
[18303] the (13) 
[18304] concert (259) 
[18305] I (805) 
[18306] called (129) 
[18307] upon (496) 
[18308] Scotland (890) 
[18309] Yard (708) 
[18310] and (108) 
[18311] upon (201) 
[18312] the (331) 
[18313] chairman (953) 
[18314] of (560) 
[18315] the (947) 
[18316] bank (655) 
[18317] directors, (440) 
[18318] with (932) 
[18319] the (812) 
[18320] result (724) 
[18321] that (949) 
[18322] you (15) 
[18323] have (997) 
[18324] seen (650) 
[18325] " (710) 
[18326] "And (522) 
[18327] how (866) 
[18328] could (348) 
[18329] you (928) 
[18330] tell (493) 
[18331] that (464) 
[18332] they (222) 
[18333] would (514) 
[18334] make (203) 
[18335] their (25) 
[18336] attempt (555) 
[18337] to (429) 
[18338] night?" (823) 
[18339] I (510) 
[18340] asked (682) 
[18341] "Well, (686) 
[18342] when (311) 
[18343] they (718) 
[18344] closed (444) 
[18345] their (608) 
[18346] League (608) 
[18347] offices (806) 
[18348] that (215) 
[18349] was (827) 
[18350] a (302) 
[18351] sign (179) 
[18352] that (973) 
[18353] they (550) 
[18354] cared (943) 
[18355] no (75) 
[18356] longer (758) 
[18357] about (459) 
[18358] Mr (978) 
[18359] Jabez (457) 
[18360] Wilson (333)

[18363] in (643) 
[18364] other (153) 
[18365] words, (391) 
[18366] that (486) 
[18367] they (952) 
[18368] had (7) 
[18369] completed (856) 
[18370] their (732) 
[18371] tunnel (964) 
[18372] But (773) 
[18373] it (418) 
[18374] was (253) 
[18375] essential (263) 
[18376] that (357) 
[18377] they (225) 
[18378] should (481) 
[18379] use (9) 
[18380] it (647) 
[18381] soon, (723) 
[18382] as (442) 
[18383] it (198) 
[18384] might (878) 
[18385] be (20) 
[18386] discovered, (216) 
[18387] or (973) 
[18388] the (799) 
[18389] bullion (34) 
[18390] might (261) 
[18391] be (950)

[18395] suit (732) 
[18396] them (361) 
[18397] better (440) 
[18398] than (47) 
[18399] any (484) 
[18400] other (46) 
[18401] day, (834) 
[18402] as (209) 
[18403] it (920) 
[18404] would (685) 
[18405] give (650) 
[18406] them (444) 
[18407] two (640)

[18409] for (375)

[18412] For (628) 
[18413] all (156) 
[18414] these (979) 
[18415] reasons (7) 
[18416] I (402) 
[18417] expected (972)

[18424] "You (378) 
[18425] reasoned (486) 
[18426] it (890) 
[18427] out (55)

[18941] in (313) 
[18942] clearing (253) 
[18943] up (703)

[18951] The (466) 
[18952] husband (605) 
[18953] was (212) 
[18954] a (734) 
[18955] teetotaler, (134) 
[18956] there (16) 
[18957] was (244) 
[18958] no (31) 
[18959] other (261)

[18961] and (726) 
[18962] the (170) 
[18963] conduct (590) 
[18964] complained (968) 
[18965] of (499) 
[18966] was (681) 
[18967] that (433) 
[18968] he (517) 
[18969] had (351) 
[18970] drifted (566) 
[18971] into (836)

[19060] I (28) 
[19061] could (290) 
[19062] not (774) 
[19063] help (989) 
[19064] commenting (588) 
[19065] upon (640) 
[19066] it (668) 
[19067] "Ah," (153) 
[19068] said (927) 
[19069] he, (930) 
[19070] "I (521)

[19106] the (781) 
[19107] ring?" (701) 
[19108] I (878) 
[19109] asked, (461) 
[19110] glancing (908) 
[19111] at (792) 
[19112] a (579)

[19116] sparkled (503)

[19137] of (179) 
[19138] such (495)

[19146] to (100)

[19149] have (806) 
[19150] been (434) 
[19151] good (725) 
[19152] enough (448) 
[19153] to (588) 
[19154] chronicle (675) 
[19155] one (622) 
[19156] or (572)

[19169] just (691) 
[19170] now?" (602) 
[19171] I (595) 
[19172] asked (543) 
[19173] with (746) 
[19174] interest (494) 
[19175] "Some (902)

[19190] you (636) 
[19191] understand, (44) 
[19192] without (851) 
[19193] being (620) 
[19194] interesting (369) 
[19195] Indeed, (52) 
[19196] I (107) 
[19197] have (854) 
[19198] found (249) 
[19199] that (925) 
[19200] it (8) 
[19201] is (49) 
[19202] usually (124) 
[19203] in (644) 
[19204] unimportant (760) 
[19205] matters (950) 
[19206] that (662) 
[19207] there (178) 
[19208] is (726) 
[19209] a (142) 
[19210] field (36) 
[19211] for (127) 
[19212] the (235) 
[19213] observation, (88) 
[19214] and (673) 
[19215] for (388) 
[19216] the (683) 
[19217] quick (997) 
[19218] analysis (50) 
[19219] of (502) 
[19220] cause (907) 
[19221] and (746) 
[19222] effect (425) 
[19223] which (896) 
[19224] gives (49) 
[19225] the (968) 
[19226] charm (177) 
[19227] to (542) 
[19228] an (519) 
[19229] investigation (246) 
[19230] The (823) 
[19231] larger (901) 
[19232] crimes (50) 
[19233] are (295) 
[19234] apt (392) 
[19235] to (587) 
[19236] be (703) 
[19237] the (427) 
[19238] simpler, (310) 
[19239] for (603) 
[19240] the (365) 
[19241] bigger (147) 
[19242] the (212) 
[19243] crime (197) 
[19244] the (242) 
[19245] more (292) 
[19246] obvious, (594) 
[19247] as (348) 
[19248] a (801) 
[19249] rule, (285) 
[19250] is (694) 
[19251] the (661) 
[19252] motive (324) 
[19253] In (232) 
[19254] these (455) 
[19255] cases, (367) 
[19256] save (531) 
[19257] for (846) 
[19258] one (992) 
[19259] rather (302) 
[19260] intricate (967) 
[19261] matter (587) 
[19262] which (806) 
[19263] has (951) 
[19264] been (392) 
[19265] referred (239) 
[19266] to (11) 
[19267] me (563) 
[19268] from (836) 
[19269] Marseilles, (310)

[19271] is (24) 
[19272] nothing (925)

[19279] It (301) 
[19280] is (564) 
[19281] possible, (51) 
[19282] however, (765) 
[19283] that (795) 
[19284] I (341) 
[19285] may (200) 
[19286] have (6) 
[19287] something (603) 
[19288] better (772) 
[19289] before (995) 
[19290] very (554) 
[19291] many (782) 
[19292] minutes (934)

[19303] I (552) 
[19304] am (213) 
[19305] much (812)

[19310] risen (652)

[19316] standing (703) 
[19317] between (844) 
[19318] the (566) 
[19319] parted (855) 
[19320] blinds (416) 
[19321] gazing (261) 
[19322] down (508) 
[19323] into (747)

[19334] I (397)

[19366] was (796) 
[19367] tilted (948) 
[19368] in (11)

[19384] peeped (361) 
[19385] up (752) 
[19386] in (689) 
[19387] a (580) 
[19388] nervous, (749) 
[19389] hesitating (525)

[19391] at (725) 
[19392] our (878) 
[19393] windows, (328) 
[19394] while (532) 
[19395] her (106) 
[19396] body (195) 
[19397] oscillated (266) 
[19398] backward (296)

[19401] and (222) 
[19402] her (739) 
[19403] fingers (562)

[19409] Suddenly, (823) 
[19410] with (546) 
[19411] a (139)

[20971] typewrite (678) 
[20972] them, (37) 
[20973] like (311) 
[20974] he (642) 
[20975] did (345) 
[20976] his, (232) 
[20977] but (622) 
[20978] he (733) 
[20979] wouldn (533)

[20982] that, (781)

[20984] he (313) 
[20985] said (92) 
[20986] that (975) 
[20987] when (585) 
[20988] I (416) 
[20989] wrote (283) 
[20990] them (558)

[20992] seemed (502) 
[20993] to (644) 
[20994] come (9) 
[20995] from (997) 
[20996] me, (324) 
[20997] but (433) 
[20998] when (587) 
[20999] they (266) 
[21000] were (57) 
[21001] typewritten (423) 
[21002] he (37) 
[21003] always (191) 
[21004] felt (591) 
[21005] that (362) 
[21006] the (630) 
[21007] machine (534) 
[21008] had (343) 
[21009] come (559) 
[21010] between (396) 
[21011] us (92)

[21014] just (489) 
[21015] show (311) 
[21016] you (114) 
[21017] how (149) 
[21018] fond (495) 
[21019] he (202) 
[21020] was (453) 
[21021] of (247) 
[21022] me, (205) 
[21023] Mr (112) 
[21024] Holmes, (63) 
[21025] and (987) 
[21026] the (162) 
[21027] little (586) 
[21028] things (224) 
[21029] that (544) 
[21030] he (64) 
[21031] would (845) 
[21032] think (1) 
[21033] of (104) 
[21034] " (256) 
[21035] "It (488) 
[21036] was (105) 
[21037] most (489) 
[21038] suggestive," (535) 
[21039] said (815) 
[21040] Holmes (152) 
[21041] "It (853)

[21046] axiom (450) 
[21047] of (14)

[21121] young, (225) 
[21122] he (40)

[21170] what (66) 
[21171] happened (282) 
[21172] when (412)

[21175] your (855)

[21180] "Mr (935)

[21186] house (534) 
[21187] again (869) 
[21188] and (132) 
[21189] proposed (604)

[21198] He (231) 
[21199] was (817) 
[21200] in (353) 
[21201] dreadful (82) 
[21202] earnest (212) 
[21203] and (419) 
[21204] made (620) 
[21205] me (907) 
[21206] swear, (353) 
[21207] with (89) 
[21208] my (538) 
[21209] hands (927)

[21214] whatever (116)

[21225] he (998) 
[21226] was (182) 
[21227] quite (301) 
[21228] right (548) 
[21229] to (648) 
[21230] make (729) 
[21231] me (64) 
[21232] swear, (365) 
[21233] and (643) 
[21234] that (436) 
[21235] it (32) 
[21236] was (749) 
[21237] a (959) 
[21238] sign (678) 
[21239] of (463) 
[21240] his (149) 
[21241] passion (685) 
[21242] Mother (433) 
[21243] was (211) 
[21244] all (887) 
[21245] in (918) 
[21246] his (237) 
[21247] favour (113) 
[21248] from (727) 
[21249] the (602) 
[21250] first (184) 
[21251] and (410) 
[21252] was (396) 
[21253] even (594) 
[21254] fonder (154) 
[21255] of (608) 
[21256] him (551) 
[21257] than (580) 
[21258] I (776) 
[21259] was (165) 
[21260] Then, (961) 
[21261] when (648) 
[21262] they (224) 
[21263] talked (767) 
[21264] of (97) 
[21265] marrying (795) 
[21266] within (159) 
[21267] the (954) 
[21268] week, (501) 
[21269] I (976) 
[21270] began (405) 
[21271] to (24) 
[21272] ask (351) 
[21273] about (794) 
[21274] father; (17) 
[21275] but (693) 
[21276] they (197) 
[21277] both (661) 
[21278] said (767) 
[21279] never (300) 
[21280] to (186) 
[21281] mind (254) 
[21282] about (787) 
[21283] father, (493) 
[21284] but (189) 
[21285] just (405) 
[21286] to (510) 
[21287] tell (163) 
[21288] him (574) 
[21289] afterwards, (755) 
[21290] and (388) 
[21291] mother (154) 
[21292] said (724) 
[21293] she (160) 
[21294] would (360) 
[21295] make (927) 
[21296] it (434) 
[21297] all (649) 
[21298] right (425) 
[21299] with (16) 
[21300] him (569) 
[21301] I (192) 
[21302] didn (96) 
[21303] t (42) 
[21304] quite (911) 
[21305] like (302) 
[21306] that, (598) 
[21307] Mr (627) 
[21308] Holmes (137) 
[21309] It (594) 
[21310] seemed (369) 
[21311] funny (113) 
[21312] that (583) 
[21313] I (807) 
[21314] should (688) 
[21315] ask (877) 
[21316] his (264) 
[21317] leave, (640) 
[21318] as (818) 
[21319] he (966) 
[21320] was (441) 
[21321] only (270) 
[21322] a (505) 
[21323] few (533) 
[21324] years (184) 
[21325] older (249) 
[21326] than (789) 
[21327] me; (469) 
[21328] but (193) 
[21329] I (272) 
[21330] didn (803) 
[21331] t (319) 
[21332] want (591) 
[21333] to (203) 
[21334] do (970) 
[21335] anything (590) 
[21336] on (862) 
[21337] the (520) 
[21338] sly, (158) 
[21339] so (241) 
[21340] I (728) 
[21341] wrote (867) 
[21342] to (229) 
[21343] father (566) 
[21344] at (265) 
[21345] Bordeaux, (554)

[21347] the (864)

[21350] its (698) 
[21351] French (192) 
[21352] offices, (625) 
[21353] but (786) 
[21354] the (761) 
[21355] letter (179) 
[21356] came (592) 
[21357] back (104)

[21360] on (939)

[21362] very (317) 
[21363] morning (820)

[21480] wheeler (664) 
[21481] drove (656) 
[21482] up (53) 
[21483] we (935) 
[21484] waited (326) 
[21485] for (750) 
[21486] him (664) 
[21487] to (679) 
[21488] step (15) 
[21489] out, (817) 
[21490] but (751) 
[21491] he (731) 
[21492] never (988) 
[21493] did, (702) 
[21494] and (234) 
[21495] when (876) 
[21496] the (99) 
[21497] cabman (240) 
[21498] got (79) 
[21499] down (408) 
[21500] from (454) 
[21501] the (968) 
[21502] box (747) 
[21503] and (27) 
[21504] looked (836)

[21507] no (867) 
[21508] one (363) 
[21509] there (587) 
[21510] The (112) 
[21511] cabman (596) 
[21512] said (347) 
[21513] that (595) 
[21514] he (338) 
[21515] could (223) 
[21516] not (189) 
[21517] imagine (235) 
[21518] what (174) 
[21519] had (575) 
[21520] become (167) 
[21521] of (426) 
[21522] him, (795) 
[21523] for (301) 
[21524] he (675) 
[21525] had (516) 
[21526] seen (908)

[21529] in (703) 
[21530] with (399) 
[21531] his (922) 
[21532] own (649) 
[21533] eyes (779) 
[21534] That (163) 
[21535] was (447) 
[21536] last (383) 
[21537] Friday, (804) 
[21538] Mr (153) 
[21539] Holmes, (226) 
[21540] and (701) 
[21541] I (380) 
[21542] have (703)

[21545] or (376) 
[21546] heard (808) 
[21547] anything (68) 
[21548] since (318) 
[21549] then (723) 
[21550] to (743) 
[21551] throw (218) 
[21552] any (744) 
[21553] light (361) 
[21554] upon (646) 
[21555] what (46) 
[21556] became (513) 
[21557] of (199) 
[21558] him (162) 
[21559] " (958) 
[21560] "It (13) 
[21561] seems (594) 
[21562] to (695) 
[21563] me (599) 
[21564] that (382) 
[21565] you (875) 
[21566] have (46) 
[21567] been (358) 
[21568] very (219) 
[21569] shamefully (709) 
[21570] treated," (480) 
[21571] said (572) 
[21572] Holmes (707) 
[21573] "Oh, (72) 
[21574] no, (297) 
[21575] sir (910) 
[21576] He (47) 
[21577] was (89) 
[21578] too (868) 
[21579] good (210) 
[21580] and (414) 
[21581] kind (871) 
[21582] to (804) 
[21583] leave (569)

[21586] Why, (8) 
[21587] all (182) 
[21588] the (723) 
[21589] morning (458) 
[21590] he (740) 
[21591] was (115) 
[21592] saying (567) 
[21593] to (157) 
[21594] me (299) 
[21595] that, (215) 
[21596] whatever (938) 
[21597] happened, (483) 
[21598] I (502) 
[21599] was (388) 
[21600] to (748) 
[21601] be (684) 
[21602] true; (645) 
[21603] and (870) 
[21604] that (226) 
[21605] even (612) 
[21606] if (665) 
[21607] something (782) 
[21608] quite (977) 
[21609] unforeseen (136) 
[21610] occurred (723) 
[21611] to (164) 
[21612] separate (246) 
[21613] us, (273) 
[21614] I (420) 
[21615] was (505) 
[21616] always (445) 
[21617] to (851) 
[21618] remember (593) 
[21619] that (340) 
[21620] I (698) 
[21621] was (291) 
[21622] pledged (662) 
[21623] to (570) 
[21624] him, (947) 
[21625] and (305) 
[21626] that (421) 
[21627] he (578) 
[21628] would (96) 
[21629] claim (208) 
[21630] his (117) 
[21631] pledge (666) 
[21632] sooner (378) 
[21633] or (178) 
[21634] later (215) 
[21635] It (501) 
[21636] seemed (87) 
[21637] strange (751) 
[21638] talk (9) 
[21639] for (775) 
[21640] a (268) 
[21641] wedding (372) 
[21642] morning, (946) 
[21643] but (405) 
[21644] what (852)

[21646] happened (882)

[21664] some (525)

[22497] Sherlock (112) 
[22498] Holmes (369) 
[22499] clapped (629) 
[22500] his (877) 
[22501] hands (729) 
[22502] softly (564) 
[22503] together (861) 
[22504] and (726) 
[22505] chuckled (373) 
[22506] " (22) 
[22507] Pon (695) 
[22508] my (858) 
[22509] word, (202) 
[22510] Watson, (988) 
[22511] you (169) 
[22512] are (837) 
[22513] coming (230) 
[22514] along (391) 
[22515] wonderfully (900) 
[22516] You (844) 
[22517] have (403) 
[22518] really (140) 
[22519] done (235) 
[22520] very (171) 
[22521] well (897) 
[22522] indeed (574) 
[22523] It (174) 
[22524] is (360) 
[22525] true (954) 
[22526] that (10) 
[22527] you (61) 
[22528] have (926) 
[22529] missed (769) 
[22530] everything (472) 
[22531] of (710) 
[22532] importance, (42) 
[22533] but (762) 
[22534] you (951) 
[22535] have (508) 
[22536] hit (936) 
[22537] upon (825) 
[22538] the (727) 
[22539] method, (135) 
[22540] and (947) 
[22541] you (492) 
[22542] have (455) 
[22543] a (835) 
[22544] quick (876) 
[22545] eye (712) 
[22546] for (170) 
[22547] colour (525) 
[22548] Never (343) 
[22549] trust (465) 
[22550] to (583) 
[22551] general (474) 
[22552] impressions, (951) 
[22553] my (825) 
[22554] boy, (166) 
[22555] but (162) 
[22556] concentrate (686) 
[22557] yourself (741) 
[22558] upon (827) 
[22559] details (899) 
[22560] My (107) 
[22561] first (7) 
[22562] glance (670) 
[22563] is (61) 
[22564] always (684) 
[22565] at (543) 
[22566] a (409) 
[22567] woman (78)

[22569] sleeve (154) 
[22570] In (153) 
[22571] a (343) 
[22572] man (417) 
[22573] it (246) 
[22574] is (905) 
[22575] perhaps (802) 
[22576] better (956) 
[22577] first (726) 
[22578] to (453) 
[22579] take (825) 
[22580] the (719) 
[22581] knee (901) 
[22582] of (38) 
[22583] the (518) 
[22584] trouser (125) 
[22585] As (375) 
[22586] you (788) 
[22587] observe, (912) 
[22588] this (436) 
[22589] woman (435) 
[22590] had (315) 
[22591] plush (829) 
[22592] upon (119) 
[22593] her (941) 
[22594] sleeves, (335) 
[22595] which (779) 
[22596] is (249) 
[22597] a (487) 
[22598] most (854) 
[22599] useful (824) 
[22600] material (831) 
[22601] for (870) 
[22602] showing (311) 
[22603] traces (779) 
[22604] The (257) 
[22605] double (296) 
[22606] line (51)

[22608] little (123) 
[22609] above (636) 
[22610] the (494) 
[22611] wrist, (290) 
[22612] where (546) 
[22613] the (802) 
[22614] typewritist (123) 
[22615] presses (145) 
[22616] against (256) 
[22617] the (99) 
[22618] table, (970) 
[22619] was (515) 
[22620] beautifully (975) 
[22621] defined (74) 
[22622] The (127) 
[22623] sewing (489) 
[22624] machine, (559) 
[22625] of (716) 
[22626] the (853) 
[22627] hand (666) 
[22628] type, (756) 
[22629] leaves (464) 
[22630] a (58) 
[22631] similar (604) 
[22632] mark, (909) 
[22633] but (478) 
[22634] only (230) 
[22635] on (712) 
[22636] the (644) 
[22637] left (769) 
[22638] arm, (770) 
[22639] and (726) 
[22640] on (624) 
[22641] the (613) 
[22642] side (519) 
[22643] of (146) 
[22644] it (154) 
[22645] farthest (358) 
[22646] from (148) 
[22647] the (885) 
[22648] thumb, (91) 
[22649] instead (376) 
[22650] of (334) 
[22651] being (549) 
[22652] right (717) 
[22653] across (81) 
[22654] the (106) 
[22655] broadest (374) 
[22656] part, (25) 
[22657] as (381) 
[22658] this (417) 
[22659] was (808) 
[22660] I (673) 
[22661] then (89) 
[22662] glanced (548) 
[22663] at (732) 
[22664] her (762) 
[22665] face, (896) 
[22666] and, (407) 
[22667] observing (91) 
[22668] the (933) 
[22669] dint (731) 
[22670] of (945) 
[22671] a (307) 
[22672] pince (415) 
[22673] nez (875) 
[22674] at (877) 
[22675] either (624) 
[22676] side (734) 
[22677] of (549) 
[22678] her (86) 
[22679] nose, (568) 
[22680] I (131) 
[22681] ventured (408) 
[22682] a (163) 
[22683] remark (659) 
[22684] upon (176) 
[22685] short (901) 
[22686] sight (359) 
[22687] and (731) 
[22688] typewriting, (329) 
[22689] which (482) 
[22690] seemed (268) 
[22691] to (220) 
[22692] surprise (396) 
[22693] her (83) 
[22694] " (333) 
[22695] "It (868) 
[22696] surprised (270) 
[22697] me (698) 
[22698] " (312) 
[22699] "But, (779) 
[22700] surely, (600) 
[22701] it (202) 
[22702] was (901) 
[22703] obvious (257) 
[22704] I (347) 
[22705] was (117) 
[22706] then (377) 
[22707] much (61) 
[22708] surprised (153) 
[22709] and (174) 
[22710] interested (304) 
[22711] on (996) 
[22712] glancing (243) 
[22713] down (336) 
[22714] to (253) 
[22715] observe (905) 
[22716] that, (327) 
[22717] though (372) 
[22718] the (837) 
[22719] boots (378) 
[22720] which (163) 
[22721] she (435) 
[22722] was (210) 
[22723] wearing (237) 
[22724] were (744) 
[22725] not (273) 
[22726] unlike (361) 
[22727] each (336) 
[22728] other, (273) 
[22729] they (392) 
[22730] were (17) 
[22731] really (895) 
[22732] odd (343) 
[22733] ones; (63) 
[22734] the (319) 
[22735] one (290) 
[22736] having (489) 
[22737] a (698) 
[22738] slightly (42) 
[22739] decorated (281) 
[22740] toe (797)

[22748] One (65) 
[22749] was (170) 
[22750] buttoned (247) 
[22751] only (564) 
[22752] in (27) 
[22753] the (641) 
[22754] two (269) 
[22755] lower (959) 
[22756] buttons (732) 
[22757] out (392) 
[22758] of (190) 
[22759] five, (849) 
[22760] and (362) 
[22761] the (644) 
[22762] other (202) 
[22763] at (333) 
[22764] the (139) 
[22765] first, (307) 
[22766] third, (899) 
[22767] and (188) 
[22768] fifth (876) 
[22769] Now, (145) 
[22770] when (683) 
[22771] you (678) 
[22772] see (722) 
[22773] that (233) 
[22774] a (940) 
[22775] young (721) 
[22776] lady, (763) 
[22777] otherwise (196) 
[22778] neatly (514) 
[22779] dressed, (32) 
[22780] has (670) 
[22781] come (287) 
[22782] away (494) 
[22783] from (552) 
[22784] home (75) 
[22785] with (300) 
[22786] odd (420) 
[22787] boots, (425) 
[22788] half (249) 
[22789] buttoned, (390) 
[22790] it (760)

[22792] no (372) 
[22793] great (850) 
[22794] deduction (479) 
[22795] to (181) 
[22796] say (176) 
[22797] that (324) 
[22798] she (524) 
[22799] came (436) 
[22800] away (754) 
[22801] in (470) 
[22802] a (554) 
[22803] hurry (681)

[22805] "And (147) 
[22806] what (324) 
[22807] else?" (43) 
[22808] I (98) 
[22809] asked, (300) 
[22810] keenly (669) 
[22811] interested, (981) 
[22812] as (235) 
[22813] I (932) 
[22814] always (750) 
[22815] was, (19) 
[22816] by (540) 
[22817] my (177) 
[22818] friend (366) 
[22819] s (122) 
[22820] incisive (964) 
[22821] reasoning (241) 
[22822] "I (919) 
[22823] noted, (452) 
[22824] in (38) 
[22825] passing, (317) 
[22826] that (775) 
[22827] she (897) 
[22828] had (972) 
[22829] written (109) 
[22830] a (0) 
[22831] note (505) 
[22832] before (50) 
[22833] leaving (955) 
[22834] home (731) 
[22835] but (170) 
[22836] after (259) 
[22837] being (259) 
[22838] fully (55) 
[22839] dressed (675) 
[22840] You (449) 
[22841] observed (357) 
[22842] that (983) 
[22843] her (536) 
[22844] right (514) 
[22845] glove (678) 
[22846] was (324) 
[22847] torn (96) 
[22848] at (382) 
[22849] the (192) 
[22850] forefinger, (725) 
[22851] but (857) 
[22852] you (387) 
[22853] did (916) 
[22854] not (623) 
[22855] apparently (905) 
[22856] see (142) 
[22857] that (207) 
[22858] both (870) 
[22859] glove (990) 
[22860] and (601) 
[22861] finger (929) 
[22862] were (770) 
[22863] stained (633) 
[22864] with (824) 
[22865] violet (534) 
[22866] ink (13) 
[22867] She (138) 
[22868] had (968) 
[22869] written (735) 
[22870] in (929) 
[22871] a (901) 
[22872] hurry (918) 
[22873] and (555) 
[22874] dipped (157) 
[22875] her (982) 
[22876] pen (264) 
[22877] too (481) 
[22878] deep (585) 
[22879] It (771) 
[22880] must (985) 
[22881] have (140) 
[22882] been (644) 
[22883] this (689) 
[22884] morning, (174) 
[22885] or (193) 
[22886] the (671) 
[22887] mark (841) 
[22888] would (616) 
[22889] not (70) 
[22890] remain (988) 
[22891] clear (623) 
[22892] upon (963) 
[22893] the (612) 
[22894] finger (524) 
[22895] All (654) 
[22896] this (44) 
[22897] is (656) 
[22898] amusing, (358) 
[22899] though (306) 
[22900] rather (809) 
[22901] elementary, (332) 
[22902] but (776) 
[22903] I (516) 
[22904] must (611) 
[22905] go (252) 
[22906] back (117) 
[22907] to (188)

[23434] at (53)

[23463] found (420) 
[23464] myself (274) 
[23465] free (172) 
[23466] and (275) 
[23467] was (713) 
[23468] able (780) 
[23469] to (592) 
[23470] spring (545)

[23479] half (440) 
[23480] afraid (265) 
[23481] that (983) 
[23482] I (449) 
[23483] might (753) 
[23484] be (254) 
[23485] too (316)

[23514] of (413) 
[23515] his (373) 
[23516] armchair (760) 
[23517] A (435) 
[23518] formidable (412) 
[23519] array (618) 
[23520] of (779) 
[23521] bottles (103) 
[23522] and (846) 
[23523] test (4) 
[23524] tubes, (189) 
[23525] with (689) 
[23526] the (238) 
[23527] pungent (446) 
[23528] cleanly (3) 
[23529] smell (661) 
[23530] of (416) 
[23531] hydrochloric (720) 
[23532] acid, (295) 
[23533] told (280) 
[23534] me (15) 
[23535] that (493) 
[23536] he (398) 
[23537] had (986) 
[23538] spent (662) 
[23539] his (36) 
[23540] day (972) 
[23541] in (632) 
[23542] the (84) 
[23543] chemical (899) 
[23544] work (258) 
[23545] which (700) 
[23546] was (720) 
[23547] so (340) 
[23548] dear (593) 
[23549] to (565) 
[23550] him (664) 
[23551] "Well, (788) 
[23552] have (326) 
[23553] you (952) 
[23554] solved (879) 
[23555] it?" (884) 
[23556] I (41) 
[23557] asked (641) 
[23558] as (331) 
[23559] I (52) 
[23560] entered (962) 
[23561] "Yes (4) 
[23562] It (693) 
[23563] was (334) 
[23564] the (392) 
[23565] bisulphate (842) 
[23566] of (495) 
[23567] baryta (0)

[23572] mystery (950)

[23574] I (717) 
[23575] cried (387) 
[23576] "Oh, (440) 
[23577] that (162) 
[23578] I (123) 
[23579] thought (205) 
[23580] of (192) 
[23581] the (86) 
[23582] salt (658) 
[23583] that (790) 
[23584] I (344) 
[23585] have (328) 
[23586] been (430) 
[23587] working (360)

[23595] the (7) 
[23596] matter, (106) 
[23597] though, (80) 
[23598] as (87) 
[23599] I (985) 
[23600] said (650) 
[23601] yesterday, (352) 
[23602] some (924) 
[23603] of (740) 
[23604] the (811)

[23607] of (290) 
[23608] interest (161) 
[23609] The (17) 
[23610] only (612) 
[23611] drawback (990) 
[23612] is (672) 
[23613] that (55) 
[23614] there (42) 
[23615] is (999) 
[23616] no (456) 
[23617] law, (958) 
[23618] I (387) 
[23619] fear, (867) 
[23620] that (765) 
[23621] can (624) 
[23622] touch (708) 
[23623] the (876) 
[23624] scoundrel (832) 
[23625] " (1) 
[23626] "Who (966) 
[23627] was (140) 
[23628] he, (662) 
[23629] then, (581) 
[23630] and (838) 
[23631] what (907) 
[23632] was (663) 
[23633] his (33) 
[23634] object (142) 
[23635] in (179) 
[23636] deserting (229) 
[23637] Miss (32) 
[23638] Sutherland?" (670) 
[23639] The (228) 
[23640] question (545) 
[23641] was (946) 
[23642] hardly (168) 
[23643] out (333) 
[23644] of (328) 
[23645] my (627) 
[23646] mouth, (445) 
[23647] and (124) 
[23648] Holmes (636) 
[23649] had (356) 
[23650] not (436) 
[23651] yet (427) 
[23652] opened (601) 
[23653] his (989) 
[23654] lips (941) 
[23655] to (369) 
[23656] reply, (300) 
[23657] when (995) 
[23658] we (95) 
[23659] heard (208) 
[23660] a (675) 
[23661] heavy (351) 
[23662] footfall (852) 
[23663] in (293) 
[23664] the (258) 
[23665] passage (269) 
[23666] and (417) 
[23667] a (608)

[23700] The (984) 
[23701] man (471) 
[23702] who (529) 
[23703] entered (133)

[23706] sturdy, (176) 
[23707] middle (136) 
[23708] sized (553) 
[23709] fellow, (352) 
[23710] some (144) 
[23711] thirty (529)

[23713] of (849) 
[23714] age, (751) 
[23715] clean (562) 
[23716] shaven, (454) 
[23717] and (482) 
[23718] sallow (171) 
[23719] skinned, (81) 
[23720] with (298) 
[23721] a (965) 
[23722] bland, (434) 
[23723] insinuating (902) 
[23724] manner, (72) 
[23725] and (943) 
[23726] a (784) 
[23727] pair (69) 
[23728] of (529) 
[23729] wonderfully (470) 
[23730] sharp (213) 
[23731] and (528) 
[23732] penetrating (262) 
[23733] grey (725) 
[23734] eyes (99) 
[23735] He (858) 
[23736] shot (905) 
[23737] a (377) 
[23738] questioning (393) 
[23739] glance (617) 
[23740] at (945) 
[23741] each (350) 
[23742] of (16) 
[23743] us, (702)

[23754] a (715) 
[23755] slight (755) 
[23756] bow (155) 
[23757] sidled (203) 
[23758] down (604) 
[23759] into (637) 
[23760] the (374)

[23769] Holmes (679) 
[23770] "I (813)

[23812] I (194) 
[23813] am (924) 
[23814] sorry (648) 
[23815] that (781)

[23822] this (631) 
[23823] little (258) 
[23824] matter, (846) 
[23825] for (407) 
[23826] I (68) 
[23827] think (386) 
[23828] it (72) 
[23829] is (286) 
[23830] far (796) 
[23831] better (632) 
[23832] not (475) 
[23833] to (710) 
[23834] wash (635) 
[23835] linen (355) 
[23836] of (331) 
[23837] the (952) 
[23838] sort (507) 
[23839] in (936) 
[23840] public (88) 
[23841] It (186) 
[23842] was (519) 
[23843] quite (124) 
[23844] against (489) 
[23845] my (269) 
[23846] wishes (423) 
[23847] that (772) 
[23848] she (534) 
[23849] came, (428) 
[23850] but (159) 
[23851] she (205) 
[23852] is (986) 
[23853] a (452) 
[23854] very (487) 
[23855] excitable, (966) 
[23856] impulsive (937) 
[23857] girl, (332) 
[23858] as (157) 
[23859] you (622) 
[23860] may (822) 
[23861] have (370) 
[23862] noticed, (957) 
[23863] and (94) 
[23864] she (649) 
[23865] is (328) 
[23866] not (442) 
[23867] easily (537) 
[23868] controlled (626) 
[23869] when (475) 
[23870] she (831) 
[23871] has (467) 
[23872] made (830) 
[23873] up (393) 
[23874] her (335) 
[23875] mind (242) 
[23876] on (359) 
[23877] a (435)

[23881] I (779) 
[23882] did (972) 
[23883] not (154) 
[23884] mind (579) 
[23885] you (549) 
[23886] so (904) 
[23887] much, (807) 
[23888] as (135) 
[23889] you (393) 
[23890] are (3) 
[23891] not (122) 
[23892] connected (596)

[23894] the (321) 
[23895] official (260) 
[23896] police, (967) 
[23897] but (706) 
[23898] it (260) 
[23899] is (65) 
[23900] not (829) 
[23901] pleasant (222) 
[23902] to (950)

[23908] this (505) 
[23909] noised (637) 
[23910] abroad (468) 
[23911] Besides, (186) 
[23912] it (547) 
[23913] is (628) 
[23914] a (46) 
[23915] useless (482) 
[23916] expense, (780) 
[23917] for (612) 
[23918] how (527) 
[23919] could (490) 
[23920] you (45) 
[23921] possibly (163) 
[23922] find (883) 
[23923] this (427)

[23926] "On (528) 
[23927] the (8) 
[23928] contrary," (627) 
[23929] said (419) 
[23930] Holmes (371) 
[23931] quietly; (779) 
[23932] "I (646)

[23950] gave (131) 
[23951] a (83) 
[23952] violent (595) 
[23953] start (438) 
[23954] and (415) 
[23955] dropped (664)

[23966] "It (376)

[23971] remarked (696) 
[23972] Holmes, (260) 
[23973] "that (603)

[24022] Windibank, (111) 
[24023] that (986) 
[24024] in (76) 
[24025] every (410) 
[24026] case (18) 
[24027] there (891) 
[24028] is (431) 
[24029] some (844) 
[24030] little (210) 
[24031] slurring (27) 
[24032] over (536) 
[24033] of (343) 
[24034] the (447) 
[24035] e, (460) 
[24036] and (857) 
[24037] a (472) 
[24038] slight (200) 
[24039] defect (974) 
[24040] in (585) 
[24041] the (615) 
[24042] tail (177) 
[24043] of (211) 
[24044] the (982)

[24046] There (356) 
[24047] are (802) 
[24048] fourteen (202) 
[24049] other (6) 
[24050] characteristics, (579) 
[24051] but (543) 
[24052] those (646) 
[24053] are (775) 
[24054] the (751) 
[24055] more (759) 
[24056] obvious (211) 
[24057] " (956) 
[24058] "We (388) 
[24059] do (808) 
[24060] all (39) 
[24061] our (935) 
[24062] correspondence (864) 
[24063] with (570) 
[24064] this (524) 
[24065] machine (437) 
[24066] at (341) 
[24067] the (788) 
[24068] office, (525) 
[24069] and (371) 
[24070] no (809) 
[24071] doubt (359) 
[24072] it (54) 
[24073] is (509) 
[24074] a (542) 
[24075] little (170) 
[24076] worn," (621) 
[24077] our (241) 
[24078] visitor (956) 
[24079] answered, (146) 
[24080] glancing (119) 
[24081] keenly (530) 
[24082] at (821) 
[24083] Holmes (246) 
[24084] with (145) 
[24085] his (75) 
[24086] bright (124) 
[24087] little (17) 
[24088] eyes (675) 
[24089] "And (606) 
[24090] now (343) 
[24091] I (217) 
[24092] will (467) 
[24093] show (162) 
[24094] you (438) 
[24095] what (177) 
[24096] is (842) 
[24097] really (277) 
[24098] a (522)

[24104] Holmes (217) 
[24105] continued (785) 
[24106] "I (473) 
[24107] think (343) 
[24108] of (61)

[24137] I (859) 
[24138] have (295) 
[24139] here (7) 
[24140] four (705) 
[24141] letters (820) 
[24142] which (831) 
[24143] purport (255) 
[24144] to (803)

[24157] not (767)

[24169] but (21) 
[24170] you (333) 
[24171] will (749) 
[24172] observe, (584) 
[24173] if (86) 
[24174] you (215) 
[24175] care (707)

[24186] to (261) 
[24187] which (431) 
[24188] I (436) 
[24189] have (487)

[24196] Mr (17) 
[24197] Windibank (749) 
[24198] sprang (913) 
[24199] out (126) 
[24200] of (937) 
[24201] his (445) 
[24202] chair (673) 
[24203] and (937) 
[24204] picked (535) 
[24205] up (329) 
[24206] his (311) 
[24207] hat (656) 
[24208] "I (488) 
[24209] cannot (883) 
[24210] waste (27) 
[24211] time (685) 
[24212] over (306) 
[24213] this (38) 
[24214] sort (670) 
[24215] of (825) 
[24216] fantastic (235) 
[24217] talk, (363) 
[24218] Mr (189) 
[24219] Holmes," (390) 
[24220] he (249) 
[24221] said (681) 
[24222] "If (315) 
[24223] you (736)

[24231] let (452) 
[24232] me (886) 
[24233] know (597) 
[24234] when (848) 
[24235] you (764) 
[24236] have (243) 
[24237] done (573) 
[24238] it (827)

[24240] "Certainly," (675) 
[24241] said (730) 
[24242] Holmes, (69) 
[24243] stepping (474) 
[24244] over (200) 
[24245] and (592) 
[24246] turning (434) 
[24247] the (521) 
[24248] key (688)

[24255] know, (153) 
[24256] then, (649) 
[24257] that (692) 
[24258] I (412) 
[24259] have (524) 
[24260] caught (596)

[24263] "What (767) 
[24264] where?" (504) 
[24265] shouted (223) 
[24266] Mr (35) 
[24267] Windibank, (734) 
[24268] turning (991) 
[24269] white (63) 
[24270] to (526) 
[24271] his (939) 
[24272] lips (610) 
[24273] and (564) 
[24274] glancing (394) 
[24275] about (974) 
[24276] him (298) 
[24277] like (183) 
[24278] a (383) 
[24279] rat (377) 
[24280] in (645) 
[24281] a (51) 
[24282] trap (388) 
[24283] "Oh, (41) 
[24284] it (957) 
[24285] won (202) 
[24286] t (424) 
[24287] do (601) 
[24288] really (459) 
[24289] it (977)

[24292] said (462) 
[24293] Holmes (791) 
[24294] suavely (78) 
[24295] "There (185) 
[24296] is (781)

[24302] it, (709) 
[24303] Mr (92) 
[24304] Windibank (467) 
[24305] It (857) 
[24306] is (480) 
[24307] quite (470) 
[24308] too (575) 
[24309] transparent, (720) 
[24310] and (548) 
[24311] it (400) 
[24312] was (574) 
[24313] a (481) 
[24314] very (801) 
[24315] bad (463) 
[24316] compliment (609) 
[24317] when (964) 
[24318] you (619) 
[24319] said (117) 
[24320] that (920) 
[24321] it (678)

[24325] me (307) 
[24326] to (712) 
[24327] solve (408) 
[24328] so (471) 
[24329] simple (279) 
[24330] a (511) 
[24331] question (505)

[24336] down (497) 
[24337] and (729) 
[24338] let (504) 
[24339] us (731) 
[24340] talk (295)

[24344] Our (20) 
[24345] visitor (368) 
[24346] collapsed (442) 
[24347] into (694) 
[24348] a (294) 
[24349] chair, (546) 
[24350] with (747) 
[24351] a (702) 
[24352] ghastly (100)

[24355] a (254) 
[24356] glitter (288) 
[24357] of (200) 
[24358] moisture (39)

[24403] me (866)

[24405] run (865) 
[24406] over (595)

[24433] upon (350)

[24463] talking, (119) 
[24464] rather (211) 
[24465] to (628) 
[24466] himself, (448) 
[24467] as (861) 
[24468] it (665) 
[24469] seemed, (792)

[24523] made (309) 
[24524] a (915) 
[24525] serious (117) 
[24526] difference (955)

[24528] was (658) 
[24529] worth (364) 
[24530] an (62) 
[24531] effort (4) 
[24532] to (862) 
[24533] preserve (904) 
[24534] it (977) 
[24535] The (586) 
[24536] daughter (663) 
[24537] was (971) 
[24538] of (193) 
[24539] a (384) 
[24540] good, (515) 
[24541] amiable (265) 
[24542] disposition, (92) 
[24543] but (385) 
[24544] affectionate (173) 
[24545] and (239) 
[24546] warm (870) 
[24547] hearted (275) 
[24548] in (179) 
[24549] her (483) 
[24550] ways, (739) 
[24551] so (950) 
[24552] that (160) 
[24553] it (126) 
[24554] was (564) 
[24555] evident (913) 
[24556] that (938) 
[24557] with (35) 
[24558] her (522) 
[24559] fair (833) 
[24560] personal (435) 
[24561] advantages, (118) 
[24562] and (390) 
[24563] her (469) 
[24564] little (62) 
[24565] income, (138) 
[24566] she (131) 
[24567] would (547) 
[24568] not (155) 
[24569] be (599) 
[24570] allowed (123) 
[24571] to (244) 
[24572] remain (425) 
[24573] single (768) 
[24574] long (342) 
[24575] Now (573) 
[24576] her (561) 
[24577] marriage (698) 
[24578] would (881) 
[24579] mean, (668) 
[24580] of (581) 
[24581] course, (39) 
[24582] the (970) 
[24583] loss (756) 
[24584] of (139) 
[24585] a (781) 
[24586] hundred (863) 
[24587] a (541) 
[24588] year, (114) 
[24589] so (450) 
[24590] what (758) 
[24591] does (955) 
[24592] her (978) 
[24593] stepfather (586) 
[24594] do (222) 
[24595] to (348) 
[24596] prevent (912) 
[24597] it? (827) 
[24598] He (496) 
[24599] takes (852) 
[24600] the (688) 
[24601] obvious (194) 
[24602] course (911) 
[24603] of (530) 
[24604] keeping (958) 
[24605] her (567) 
[24606] at (260) 
[24607] home (982) 
[24608] and (562) 
[24609] forbidding (708) 
[24610] her (442) 
[24611] to (832) 
[24612] seek (811) 
[24613] the (314) 
[24614] company (357) 
[24615] of (705) 
[24616] people (799) 
[24617] of (217) 
[24618] her (801) 
[24619] own (27) 
[24620] age (822) 
[24621] But (350) 
[24622] soon (961) 
[24623] he (765) 
[24624] found (262) 
[24625] that (175) 
[24626] that (514) 
[24627] would (670) 
[24628] not (650) 
[24629] answer (370) 
[24630] forever (528) 
[24631] She (162) 
[24632] became (289) 
[24633] restive, (219) 
[24634] insisted (182) 
[24635] upon (122) 
[24636] her (519) 
[24637] rights, (974) 
[24638] and (813) 
[24639] finally (533) 
[24640] announced (254) 
[24641] her (556) 
[24642] positive (838) 
[24643] intention (217) 
[24644] of (202) 
[24645] going (312) 
[24646] to (388) 
[24647] a (324) 
[24648] certain (992) 
[24649] ball (769) 
[24650] What (409) 
[24651] does (319) 
[24652] her (856) 
[24653] clever (304) 
[24654] stepfather (94) 
[24655] do (400) 
[24656] then? (641) 
[24657] He (80) 
[24658] conceives (348) 
[24659] an (83) 
[24660] idea (163) 
[24661] more (922) 
[24662] creditable (898) 
[24663] to (840) 
[24664] his (428) 
[24665] head (213) 
[24666] than (634) 
[24667] to (314) 
[24668] his (544) 
[24669] heart (761) 
[24670] With (522) 
[24671] the (100) 
[24672] connivance (236) 
[24673] and (418) 
[24674] assistance (886) 
[24675] of (202) 
[24676] his (916) 
[24677] wife (532) 
[24678] he (743) 
[24679] disguised (450) 
[24680] himself, (948) 
[24681] covered (659) 
[24682] those (425) 
[24683] keen (932) 
[24684] eyes (56) 
[24685] with (71) 
[24686] tinted (201) 
[24687] glasses, (747) 
[24688] masked (868) 
[24689] the (891) 
[24690] face (618) 
[24691] with (610) 
[24692] a (642) 
[24693] moustache (536) 
[24694] and (354) 
[24695] a (296) 
[24696] pair (918) 
[24697] of (441) 
[24698] bushy (268) 
[24699] whiskers, (91) 
[24700] sunk (184) 
[24701] that (272) 
[24702] clear (488) 
[24703] voice (431) 
[24704] into (529) 
[24705] an (762) 
[24706] insinuating (479) 
[24707] whisper, (948) 
[24708] and (393) 
[24709] doubly (502) 
[24710] secure (774) 
[24711] on (544) 
[24712] account (742) 
[24713] of (189) 
[24714] the (573) 
[24715] girl (827) 
[24716] s (181) 
[24717] short (177) 
[24718] sight, (270) 
[24719] he (974) 
[24720] appears (678) 
[24721] as (24) 
[24722] Mr (522) 
[24723] Hosmer (672) 
[24724] Angel, (558) 
[24725] and (466) 
[24726] keeps (233) 
[24727] off (809) 
[24728] other (179) 
[24729] lovers (876) 
[24730] by (612) 
[24731] making (524) 
[24732] love (296) 
[24733] himself (113) 
[24734] " (954) 
[24735] "It (40) 
[24736] was (447) 
[24737] only (529) 
[24738] a (598) 
[24739] joke (442) 
[24740] at (991) 
[24741] first," (486) 
[24742] groaned (363) 
[24743] our (281) 
[24744] visitor (406) 
[24745] "We (966) 
[24746] never (360) 
[24747] thought (652) 
[24748] that (715) 
[24749] she (865) 
[24750] would (42) 
[24751] have (4) 
[24752] been (886) 
[24753] so (779)

[24757] "Very (0) 
[24758] likely (951) 
[24759] not (912) 
[24760] However (884) 
[24761] that (917) 
[24762] may (933) 
[24763] be, (68) 
[24764] the (933) 
[24765] young (36) 
[24766] lady (436) 
[24767] was (803) 
[24768] very (237) 
[24769] decidedly (234) 
[24770] carried (762) 
[24771] away, (473) 
[24772] and, (653) 
[24773] having (148) 
[24774] quite (515) 
[24775] made (446) 
[24776] up (809) 
[24777] her (742) 
[24778] mind (996) 
[24779] that (515) 
[24780] her (32) 
[24781] stepfather (896) 
[24782] was (766) 
[24783] in (601) 
[24784] France, (178) 
[24785] the (471) 
[24786] suspicion (276) 
[24787] of (693) 
[24788] treachery (195) 
[24789] never (795) 
[24790] for (366) 
[24791] an (726) 
[24792] instant (86) 
[24793] entered (559) 
[24794] her (824) 
[24795] mind (59) 
[24796] She (107) 
[24797] was (368) 
[24798] flattered (648) 
[24799] by (669) 
[24800] the (873) 
[24801] gentleman (574) 
[24802] s (512) 
[24803] attentions, (882) 
[24804] and (172) 
[24805] the (470) 
[24806] effect (993) 
[24807] was (214) 
[24808] increased (255) 
[24809] by (542) 
[24810] the (572) 
[24811] loudly (106) 
[24812] expressed (531) 
[24813] admiration (569) 
[24814] of (733) 
[24815] her (413) 
[24816] mother (164) 
[24817] Then (64) 
[24818] Mr (909) 
[24819] Angel (595) 
[24820] began (889) 
[24821] to (310) 
[24822] call, (882) 
[24823] for (689) 
[24824] it (812) 
[24825] was (33) 
[24826] obvious (25) 
[24827] that (657) 
[24828] the (122) 
[24829] matter (502) 
[24830] should (368) 
[24831] be (159) 
[24832] pushed (49) 
[24833] as (275) 
[24834] far (533) 
[24835] as (603) 
[24836] it (896) 
[24837] would (449) 
[24838] go (493) 
[24839] if (884) 
[24840] a (380) 
[24841] real (34) 
[24842] effect (64) 
[24843] were (303) 
[24844] to (750) 
[24845] be (435) 
[24846] produced (867) 
[24847] There (121) 
[24848] were (206) 
[24849] meetings, (499) 
[24850] and (173) 
[24851] an (420) 
[24852] engagement, (918) 
[24853] which (839) 
[24854] would (419) 
[24855] finally (598) 
[24856] secure (617) 
[24857] the (299) 
[24858] girl (380) 
[24859] s (794) 
[24860] affections (277) 
[24861] from (264) 
[24862] turning (824) 
[24863] towards (238) 
[24864] anyone (567) 
[24865] else (210) 
[24866] But (806) 
[24867] the (944) 
[24868] deception (466) 
[24869] could (133) 
[24870] not (497) 
[24871] be (407) 
[24872] kept (123) 
[24873] up (785) 
[24874] forever (16) 
[24875] These (228) 
[24876] pretended (504) 
[24877] journeys (814) 
[24878] to (647) 
[24879] France (282) 
[24880] were (690) 
[24881] rather (255) 
[24882] cumbrous (796) 
[24883] The (798) 
[24884] thing (261) 
[24885] to (944) 
[24886] do (47) 
[24887] was (189) 
[24888] clearly (970) 
[24889] to (609) 
[24890] bring (160) 
[24891] the (899) 
[24892] business (666) 
[24893] to (82) 
[24894] an (887) 
[24895] end (448) 
[24896] in (127) 
[24897] such (292) 
[24898] a (239) 
[24899] dramatic (492) 
[24900] manner (882) 
[24901] that (775) 
[24902] it (55) 
[24903] would (286) 
[24904] leave (862) 
[24905] a (16) 
[24906] permanent (184) 
[24907] impression (938) 
[24908] upon (363) 
[24909] the (374) 
[24910] young (381) 
[24911] lady (893) 
[24912] s (872) 
[24913] mind (639) 
[24914] and (683) 
[24915] prevent (392) 
[24916] her (835) 
[24917] from (28) 
[24918] looking (942) 
[24919] upon (968) 
[24920] any (907) 
[24921] other (62) 
[24922] suitor (395) 
[24923] for (42) 
[24924] some (914) 
[24925] time (124) 
[24926] to (704) 
[24927] come (217) 
[24928] Hence (223) 
[24929] those (926) 
[24930] vows (835) 
[24931] of (493) 
[24932] fidelity (557) 
[24933] exacted (513) 
[24934] upon (207) 
[24935] a (899) 
[24936] Testament, (351) 
[24937] and (56) 
[24938] hence (522) 
[24939] also (380) 
[24940] the (480) 
[24941] allusions (22) 
[24942] to (136) 
[24943] a (148) 
[24944] possibility (523) 
[24945] of (57) 
[24946] something (171) 
[24947] happening (434) 
[24948] on (287) 
[24949] the (628) 
[24950] very (194) 
[24951] morning (719) 
[24952] of (499) 
[24953] the (682) 
[24954] wedding (193) 
[24955] James (64) 
[24956] Windibank (150) 
[24957] wished (315) 
[24958] Miss (23) 
[24959] Sutherland (807) 
[24960] to (761) 
[24961] be (775) 
[24962] so (762) 
[24963] bound (633) 
[24964] to (332) 
[24965] Hosmer (137) 
[24966] Angel, (721) 
[24967] and (492) 
[24968] so (46) 
[24969] uncertain (919) 
[24970] as (573) 
[24971] to (165) 
[24972] his (632) 
[24973] fate, (223) 
[24974] that (892) 
[24975] for (719) 
[24976] ten (89) 
[24977] years (801) 
[24978] to (233) 
[24979] come, (189) 
[24980] at (511) 
[24981] any (956) 
[24982] rate, (224) 
[24983] she (338) 
[24984] would (619) 
[24985] not (848) 
[24986] listen (187) 
[24987] to (30) 
[24988] another (615) 
[24989] man (8) 
[24990] As (294) 
[24991] far (168) 
[24992] as (394) 
[24993] the (412) 
[24994] church (349) 
[24995] door (203) 
[24996] he (977) 
[24997] brought (256) 
[24998] her, (295) 
[24999] and (59) 
[25000] then, (917) 
[25001] as (482) 
[25002] he (684) 
[25003] could (393) 
[25004] go (380) 
[25005] no (704) 
[25006] farther, (976) 
[25007] he (546) 
[25008] conveniently (177) 
[25009] vanished (229) 
[25010] away (321) 
[25011] by (560) 
[25012] the (834) 
[25013] old (634) 
[25014] trick (862) 
[25015] of (559) 
[25016] stepping (307) 
[25017] in (638) 
[25018] at (42) 
[25019] one (436) 
[25020] door (279) 
[25021] of (467) 
[25022] a (101)

[25024] wheeler (984) 
[25025] and (1) 
[25026] out (159) 
[25027] at (274) 
[25028] the (614) 
[25029] other (393) 
[25030] I (245) 
[25031] think (782) 
[25032] that (762) 
[25033] was (711) 
[25034] the (246) 
[25035] chain (174) 
[25036] of (551)

[25038] Mr (638) 
[25039] Windibank (101) 
[25040] " (358) 
[25041] Our (877) 
[25042] visitor (219) 
[25043] had (896) 
[25044] recovered (370) 
[25045] something (100) 
[25046] of (589) 
[25047] his (487) 
[25048] assurance (443) 
[25049] while (582) 
[25050] Holmes (186) 
[25051] had (84) 
[25052] been (220) 
[25053] talking, (317) 
[25054] and (567) 
[25055] he (155) 
[25056] rose (721) 
[25057] from (56) 
[25058] his (600) 
[25059] chair (770) 
[25060] now (52) 
[25061] with (119) 
[25062] a (65) 
[25063] cold (886) 
[25064] sneer (816) 
[25065] upon (525) 
[25066] his (472) 
[25067] pale (78) 
[25068] face (333) 
[25069] "It (812) 
[25070] may (636) 
[25071] be (553) 
[25072] so, (0) 
[25073] or (682) 
[25074] it (745)

[25077] Mr (681) 
[25078] Holmes," (686) 
[25079] said (994) 
[25080] he, (643) 
[25081] "but (280)

[25086] very (740) 
[25087] sharp (826) 
[25088] you (778) 
[25089] ought (333) 
[25090] to (911) 
[25091] be (997) 
[25092] sharp (629) 
[25093] enough (879) 
[25094] to (403)

[25096] that (268) 
[25097] it (7) 
[25098] is (963) 
[25099] you (464) 
[25100] who (412) 
[25101] are (514) 
[25102] breaking (366) 
[25103] the (843) 
[25104] law (240) 
[25105] now, (878) 
[25106] and (838) 
[25107] not (718) 
[25108] me (570) 
[25109] I (746)

[25112] nothing (697) 
[25113] actionable (832) 
[25114] from (320) 
[25115] the (385)

[25117] but (36) 
[25118] as (171)

[25139] "The (880)

[25147] said (483) 
[25148] Holmes, (918) 
[25149] unlocking (658) 
[25150] and (128) 
[25151] throwing (493) 
[25152] open (830) 
[25153] the (912)

[25155] "yet (921)

[25159] a (997) 
[25160] man (881) 
[25161] who (962) 
[25162] deserved (219) 
[25163] punishment (975) 
[25164] more (565)

[25166] the (57) 
[25167] young (482)

[25170] a (257)

[25173] a (161) 
[25174] friend, (327) 
[25175] he (772)

[25187] he (822) 
[25188] continued, (481) 
[25189] flushing (162) 
[25190] up (891) 
[25191] at (289) 
[25192] the (807) 
[25193] sight (713) 
[25194] of (428) 
[25195] the (12)

[25203] "it (566)

[25221] I (235) 
[25222] think (186) 
[25223] I (603) 
[25224] shall (446) 
[25225] just (425) 
[25226] treat (439)

[25228] to (537)

[25230] He (918) 
[25231] took (951) 
[25232] two (617) 
[25233] swift (571) 
[25234] steps (579) 
[25235] to (28) 
[25236] the (760) 
[25237] whip, (925) 
[25238] but (130) 
[25239] before (265) 
[25240] he (512) 
[25241] could (666) 
[25242] grasp (576) 
[25243] it (354) 
[25244] there (124) 
[25245] was (733) 
[25246] a (610) 
[25247] wild (588) 
[25248] clatter (263) 
[25249] of (708) 
[25250] steps (787) 
[25251] upon (378) 
[25252] the (16) 
[25253] stairs, (915)

[25255] heavy (779) 
[25256] hall (868)

[25258] banged, (772) 
[25259] and (108) 
[25260] from (83) 
[25261] the (156) 
[25262] window (545) 
[25263] we (273) 
[25264] could (656) 
[25265] see (30) 
[25266] Mr (794) 
[25267] James (148) 
[25268] Windibank (636) 
[25269] running (642) 
[25270] at (624) 
[25271] the (637) 
[25272] top (313) 
[25273] of (260) 
[25274] his (769) 
[25275] speed (10) 
[25276] down (955)

[25278] road (24)

[25283] blooded (835) 
[25284] scoundrel (50) 
[25285] " (717) 
[25286] said (877) 
[25287] Holmes, (621) 
[25288] laughing, (259) 
[25289] as (999) 
[25290] he (888) 
[25291] threw (135) 
[25292] himself (168) 
[25293] down (525) 
[25294] into (369) 
[25295] his (108) 
[25296] chair (620)

[25304] crime (305) 
[25305] to (42) 
[25306] crime (940) 
[25307] until (305) 
[25308] he (119) 
[25309] does (572) 
[25310] something (31) 
[25311] very (145) 
[25312] bad, (587)

[25350] from (365) 
[25351] the (667) 
[25352] first (187)

[25364] his (688) 
[25365] curious (940) 
[25366] conduct, (483) 
[25367] and (815) 
[25368] it (157) 
[25369] was (343) 
[25370] equally (36) 
[25371] clear (119) 
[25372] that (126)

[25374] only (641) 
[25375] man (623) 
[25376] who (483) 
[25377] really (383) 
[25378] profited (174) 
[25379] by (982) 
[25380] the (667) 
[25381] incident, (684) 
[25382] as (939) 
[25383] far (848) 
[25384] as (779) 
[25385] we (422) 
[25386] could (750) 
[25387] see, (371) 
[25388] was (218) 
[25389] the (809) 
[25390] stepfather (709) 
[25391] Then (784) 
[25392] the (105) 
[25393] fact (876) 
[25394] that (813) 
[25395] the (999) 
[25396] two (706) 
[25397] men (321)

[25399] never (932) 
[25400] together, (54)

[25402] that (998) 
[25403] the (357) 
[25404] one (909) 
[25405] always (895) 
[25406] appeared (644) 
[25407] when (680) 
[25408] the (920) 
[25409] other (384) 
[25410] was (443) 
[25411] away, (488) 
[25412] was (257) 
[25413] suggestive (190) 
[25414] So (620) 
[25415] were (412) 
[25416] the (762) 
[25417] tinted (541) 
[25418] spectacles (796) 
[25419] and (36) 
[25420] the (22) 
[25421] curious (879) 
[25422] voice, (559) 
[25423] which (49) 
[25424] both (883) 
[25425] hinted (182) 
[25426] at (269) 
[25427] a (94) 
[25428] disguise, (416) 
[25429] as (714)

[25431] the (185) 
[25432] bushy (366) 
[25433] whiskers (320) 
[25434] My (37) 
[25435] suspicions (646) 
[25436] were (439) 
[25437] all (218) 
[25438] confirmed (193) 
[25439] by (369) 
[25440] his (210) 
[25441] peculiar (652) 
[25442] action (560)

[25444] typewriting (237)

[25446] signature, (508) 
[25447] which, (729) 
[25448] of (884) 
[25449] course, (954) 
[25450] inferred (773) 
[25451] that (981) 
[25452] his (169) 
[25453] handwriting (245) 
[25454] was (2) 
[25455] so (82) 
[25456] familiar (527) 
[25457] to (234) 
[25458] her (760) 
[25459] that (385) 
[25460] she (583) 
[25461] would (544) 
[25462] recognise (379) 
[25463] even (88) 
[25464] the (723) 
[25465] smallest (33)

[25472] these (308) 
[25473] isolated (317) 
[25474] facts, (111) 
[25475] together (778) 
[25476] with (968) 
[25477] many (432) 
[25478] minor (137) 
[25479] ones, (790) 
[25480] all (440) 
[25481] pointed (483) 
[25482] in (700) 
[25483] the (431)

[26813] told (398) 
[26814] her (470) 
[26815] mother (826) 
[26816] when (314)

[26834] was (331) 
[26835] afraid (202) 
[26836] that (981)

[26842] She (429) 
[26843] had (676) 
[26844] hardly (524) 
[26845] said (816) 
[26846] the (282) 
[26847] words (301) 
[26848] when (43) 
[26849] young (182) 
[26850] Mr (692) 
[26851] McCarthy (268) 
[26852] came (97) 
[26853] running (904) 
[26854] up (551) 
[26855] to (852) 
[26856] the (325) 
[26857] lodge (164) 
[26858] to (233) 
[26859] say (574) 
[26860] that (511) 
[26861] he (119) 
[26862] had (428) 
[26863] found (177) 
[26864] his (991)

[26866] dead (860) 
[26867] in (104) 
[26868] the (60) 
[26869] wood, (16) 
[26870] and (459) 
[26871] to (90) 
[26872] ask (672) 
[26873] for (460) 
[26874] the (484) 
[26875] help (148) 
[26876] of (792) 
[26877] the (181) 
[26878] lodge (892) 
[26879] keeper (362) 
[26880] He (657) 
[26881] was (68) 
[26882] much (296) 
[26883] excited, (472) 
[26884] without (972) 
[26885] either (757) 
[26886] his (891) 
[26887] gun (371) 
[26888] or (622) 
[26889] his (662) 
[26890] hat, (98) 
[26891] and (347) 
[26892] his (328) 
[26893] right (901) 
[26894] hand (960) 
[26895] and (146) 
[26896] sleeve (277) 
[26897] were (698) 
[26898] observed (81) 
[26899] to (269) 
[26900] be (250) 
[26901] stained (143) 
[26902] with (290) 
[26903] fresh (206) 
[26904] blood (480) 
[26905] On (757) 
[26906] following (797) 
[26907] him (452) 
[26908] they (291) 
[26909] found (806) 
[26910] the (320) 
[26911] dead (730) 
[26912] body (882) 
[26913] stretched (175)

[26917] grass (667) 
[26918] beside (19) 
[26919] the (845) 
[26920] pool (328) 
[26921] The (610) 
[26922] head (279) 
[26923] had (344) 
[26924] been (612) 
[26925] beaten (25) 
[26926] in (590) 
[26927] by (462) 
[26928] repeated (592) 
[26929] blows (101) 
[26930] of (109) 
[26931] some (774)

[26933] and (502) 
[26934] blunt (696) 
[26935] weapon (185) 
[26936] The (301) 
[26937] injuries (397) 
[26938] were (246) 
[26939] such (121) 
[26940] as (755) 
[26941] might (494) 
[26942] very (758) 
[26943] well (520) 
[26944] have (659) 
[26945] been (191) 
[26946] inflicted (754) 
[26947] by (610) 
[26948] the (967) 
[26949] butt (79) 
[26950] end (969)

[26956] which (430) 
[26957] was (30) 
[26958] found (376) 
[26959] lying (256) 
[26960] on (568) 
[26961] the (615) 
[26962] grass (352) 
[26963] within (190) 
[26964] a (658) 
[26965] few (735) 
[26966] paces (44) 
[26967] of (440) 
[26968] the (164) 
[26969] body (641) 
[26970] Under (918) 
[26971] these (935) 
[26972] circumstances (225) 
[26973] the (922) 
[26974] young (61) 
[26975] man (723) 
[26976] was (850) 
[26977] instantly (849) 
[26978] arrested, (744) 
[26979] and (841) 
[26980] a (174) 
[26981] verdict (627) 
[26982] of (321) 
[26983] wilful (302) 
[26984] murder (188) 
[26985] having (665) 
[26986] been (435) 
[26987] returned (883) 
[26988] at (662) 
[26989] the (503)

[26991] on (820) 
[26992] Tuesday, (292) 
[26993] he (958) 
[26994] was (395) 
[26995] on (428) 
[26996] Wednesday (801) 
[26997] brought (122) 
[26998] before (278) 
[26999] the (403) 
[27000] magistrates (400) 
[27001] at (230) 
[27002] Ross, (27) 
[27003] who (539) 
[27004] have (803) 
[27005] referred (515) 
[27006] the (409) 
[27007] case (204)

[27009] the (138) 
[27010] next (519) 
[27011] Assizes (498) 
[27012] Those (389) 
[27013] are (945) 
[27014] the (410) 
[27015] main (122) 
[27016] facts (360) 
[27017] of (435) 
[27018] the (379) 
[27019] case (281) 
[27020] as (129) 
[27021] they (585) 
[27022] came (146) 
[27023] out (531) 
[27024] before (834) 
[27025] the (168) 
[27026] coroner (321) 
[27027] and (931) 
[27028] the (404)

[27030] court (458) 
[27031] " (671) 
[27032] "I (967) 
[27033] could (595) 
[27034] hardly (379) 
[27035] imagine (560) 
[27036] a (529) 
[27037] more (338) 
[27038] damning (11) 
[27039] case," (48) 
[27040] I (97) 
[27041] remarked (784) 
[27042] "If (756)

[27060] tricky (115) 
[27061] thing," (198) 
[27062] answered (672) 
[27063] Holmes (972) 
[27064] thoughtfully (739) 
[27065] "It (435)

[27102] be (427) 
[27103] confessed, (790)

[27105] that (466) 
[27106] the (482) 
[27107] case (454)

[27109] exceedingly (393) 
[27110] grave (493) 
[27111] against (638) 
[27112] the (363) 
[27113] young (179) 
[27114] man, (15)

[27116] it (431) 
[27117] is (483) 
[27118] very (950) 
[27119] possible (600) 
[27120] that (142) 
[27121] he (107) 
[27122] is (294) 
[27123] indeed (462) 
[27124] the (93) 
[27125] culprit (355)

[27142] the (12) 
[27143] neighbouring (421) 
[27144] landowner, (351) 
[27145] who (275) 
[27146] believe (351) 
[27147] in (699) 
[27148] his (962) 
[27149] innocence, (525) 
[27150] and (617)

[27175] being (621) 
[27176] rather (714) 
[27177] puzzled, (387)

[27179] referred (276) 
[27180] the (731)

[28094] with (563) 
[28095] the (715) 
[28096] intention (424) 
[28097] of (466) 
[28098] visiting (72) 
[28099] the (603) 
[28100] rabbit (669) 
[28101] warren (874) 
[28102] which (751) 
[28103] is (607) 
[28104] upon (272) 
[28105] the (664) 
[28106] other (919) 
[28107] side (732) 
[28108] On (570) 
[28109] my (831) 
[28110] way (838) 
[28111] I (748) 
[28112] saw (260) 
[28113] William (892) 
[28114] Crowder, (622) 
[28115] the (161) 
[28116] game (248) 
[28117] keeper, (225) 
[28118] as (830) 
[28119] he (120) 
[28120] had (600) 
[28121] stated (172) 
[28122] in (285) 
[28123] his (184) 
[28124] evidence; (772) 
[28125] but (770) 
[28126] he (712) 
[28127] is (689) 
[28128] mistaken (613) 
[28129] in (110) 
[28130] thinking (640) 
[28131] that (74) 
[28132] I (745) 
[28133] was (808) 
[28134] following (907) 
[28135] my (466) 
[28136] father (357) 
[28137] I (730) 
[28138] had (24) 
[28139] no (693) 
[28140] idea (596) 
[28141] that (350) 
[28142] he (836) 
[28143] was (349) 
[28144] in (159) 
[28145] front (306) 
[28146] of (625) 
[28147] me (611) 
[28148] When (886) 
[28149] about (163) 
[28150] a (864) 
[28151] hundred (199) 
[28152] yards (547) 
[28153] from (941) 
[28154] the (698) 
[28155] pool (977) 
[28156] I (163) 
[28157] heard (399) 
[28158] a (195) 
[28159] cry (949) 
[28160] of (944) 
[28161] "Cooee (902) 
[28162] " (497) 
[28163] which (452) 
[28164] was (780) 
[28165] a (23) 
[28166] usual (338) 
[28167] signal (947) 
[28168] between (150) 
[28169] my (795) 
[28170] father (945) 
[28171] and (73) 
[28172] myself (661) 
[28173] I (646) 
[28174] then (288) 
[28175] hurried (925) 
[28176] forward, (230) 
[28177] and (353) 
[28178] found (931) 
[28179] him (448) 
[28180] standing (496) 
[28181] by (516) 
[28182] the (967) 
[28183] pool (984) 
[28184] He (458) 
[28185] appeared (444) 
[28186] to (120) 
[28187] be (535) 
[28188] much (765) 
[28189] surprised (468) 
[28190] at (66) 
[28191] seeing (784) 
[28192] me (875) 
[28193] and (130) 
[28194] asked (69) 
[28195] me (478) 
[28196] rather (829) 
[28197] roughly (935) 
[28198] what (547) 
[28199] I (553) 
[28200] was (146) 
[28201] doing (276) 
[28202] there (511) 
[28203] A (127) 
[28204] conversation (715) 
[28205] ensued (579) 
[28206] which (60) 
[28207] led (103) 
[28208] to (205) 
[28209] high (717) 
[28210] words (207) 
[28211] and (936) 
[28212] almost (289) 
[28213] to (177) 
[28214] blows, (865) 
[28215] for (316) 
[28216] my (712) 
[28217] father (426) 
[28218] was (153) 
[28219] a (890) 
[28220] man (91) 
[28221] of (821) 
[28222] a (668) 
[28223] very (744) 
[28224] violent (988) 
[28225] temper (702) 
[28226] Seeing (658) 
[28227] that (425) 
[28228] his (37) 
[28229] passion (145) 
[28230] was (270) 
[28231] becoming (770) 
[28232] ungovernable, (534) 
[28233] I (689) 
[28234] left (857) 
[28235] him (650) 
[28236] and (803) 
[28237] returned (909) 
[28238] towards (406) 
[28239] Hatherley (676) 
[28240] Farm (337) 
[28241] I (468) 
[28242] had (919) 
[28243] not (472) 
[28244] gone (353) 
[28245] more (671) 
[28246] than (716) 
[28247] 150 (195) 
[28248] yards, (413) 
[28249] however, (870) 
[28250] when (134) 
[28251] I (653) 
[28252] heard (574) 
[28253] a (657) 
[28254] hideous (679) 
[28255] outcry (555) 
[28256] behind (133) 
[28257] me, (531) 
[28258] which (296) 
[28259] caused (645) 
[28260] me (359) 
[28261] to (654) 
[28262] run (528) 
[28263] back (992) 
[28264] again (590) 
[28265] I (819) 
[28266] found (991) 
[28267] my (704) 
[28268] father (576) 
[28269] expiring (500) 
[28270] upon (537) 
[28271] the (815) 
[28272] ground, (71) 
[28273] with (344) 
[28274] his (193) 
[28275] head (258) 
[28276] terribly (621) 
[28277] injured (778) 
[28278] I (602) 
[28279] dropped (793) 
[28280] my (51) 
[28281] gun (452) 
[28282] and (715) 
[28283] held (956) 
[28284] him (396) 
[28285] in (394) 
[28286] my (423) 
[28287] arms, (453) 
[28288] but (453) 
[28289] he (807) 
[28290] almost (325) 
[28291] instantly (520) 
[28292] expired (144) 
[28293] I (877) 
[28294] knelt (613) 
[28295] beside (368) 
[28296] him (212) 
[28297] for (593) 
[28298] some (513) 
[28299] minutes, (84) 
[28300] and (352) 
[28301] then (280) 
[28302] made (935) 
[28303] my (299) 
[28304] way (986) 
[28305] to (291) 
[28306] Mr (993) 
[28307] Turner (903) 
[28308] s (136) 
[28309] lodge (569) 
[28310] keeper, (955) 
[28311] his (68) 
[28312] house (610) 
[28313] being (393) 
[28314] the (295) 
[28315] nearest, (322) 
[28316] to (725) 
[28317] ask (82) 
[28318] for (741) 
[28319] assistance (196) 
[28320] I (638) 
[28321] saw (677) 
[28322] no (820) 
[28323] one (634) 
[28324] near (497) 
[28325] my (493) 
[28326] father (905) 
[28327] when (944) 
[28328] I (889) 
[28329] returned, (859) 
[28330] and (868) 
[28331] I (971) 
[28332] have (667) 
[28333] no (711) 
[28334] idea (403) 
[28335] how (780) 
[28336] he (803) 
[28337] came (938) 
[28338] by (590) 
[28339] his (542) 
[28340] injuries (109) 
[28341] He (633) 
[28342] was (394) 
[28343] not (297) 
[28344] a (744) 
[28345] popular (683) 
[28346] man, (981) 
[28347] being (749) 
[28348] somewhat (84) 
[28349] cold (896) 
[28350] and (724) 
[28351] forbidding (566) 
[28352] in (819) 
[28353] his (712) 
[28354] manners, (820) 
[28355] but (93) 
[28356] he (462) 
[28357] had, (121) 
[28358] as (827) 
[28359] far (941) 
[28360] as (231) 
[28361] I (921) 
[28362] know, (237) 
[28363] no (932) 
[28364] active (707)

[28367] know (926) 
[28368] nothing (134) 
[28369] further (867) 
[28370] of (588) 
[28371] the (538)

[28631] I (926) 
[28632] have (874) 
[28633] a (796)

[29115] a (182)

[29128] said (203) 
[29129] Lestrade (16) 
[29130] as (223) 
[29131] we (483) 
[29132] sat (60) 
[29133] over (885) 
[29134] a (635)

[29138] "I (139)

[29143] and (370) 
[29144] that (843)

[29151] you (342)

[29221] very (846) 
[29222] much (552) 
[29223] superior (801) 
[29224] to (889) 
[29225] the (427) 
[29226] usual (952)

[29235] it (527) 
[29236] is (539) 
[29237] probable (2) 
[29238] that (206) 
[29239] I (993) 
[29240] shall (453)

[29247] Lestrade (219) 
[29248] laughed (2) 
[29249] indulgently (995) 
[29250] "You (796)

[30128] you (681) 
[30129] will (207) 
[30130] find (797) 
[30131] it (105) 
[30132] very (531) 
[30133] slow, (751) 
[30134] but (154) 
[30135] I (188) 
[30136] shall (221) 
[30137] only (717) 
[30138] be (726) 
[30139] away (572) 
[30140] a (689) 
[30141] couple (113) 
[30142] of (499) 
[30143] hours (814) 
[30144] " (982) 
[30145] I (709) 
[30146] walked (717) 
[30147] down (252) 
[30148] to (62) 
[30149] the (756) 
[30150] station (266) 
[30151] with (637) 
[30152] them, (454) 
[30153] and (625) 
[30154] then (803) 
[30155] wandered (443) 
[30156] through (248) 
[30157] the (600) 
[30158] streets (649) 
[30159] of (238) 
[30160] the (27) 
[30161] little (620) 
[30162] town, (84) 
[30163] finally (627) 
[30164] returning (6) 
[30165] to (338) 
[30166] the (339) 
[30167] hotel, (190) 
[30168] where (912) 
[30169] I (516) 
[30170] lay (409) 
[30171] upon (834) 
[30172] the (492) 
[30173] sofa (302) 
[30174] and (481) 
[30175] tried (547) 
[30176] to (938) 
[30177] interest (519) 
[30178] myself (835) 
[30179] in (820) 
[30180] a (53) 
[30181] yellow (708) 
[30182] backed (362) 
[30183] novel (955) 
[30184] The (337) 
[30185] puny (612) 
[30186] plot (121) 
[30187] of (975) 
[30188] the (169) 
[30189] story (282) 
[30190] was (549) 
[30191] so (481) 
[30192] thin, (375) 
[30193] however, (450) 
[30194] when (673) 
[30195] compared (193) 
[30196] to (72) 
[30197] the (967) 
[30198] deep (967) 
[30199] mystery (236) 
[30200] through (547) 
[30201] which (81) 
[30202] we (544) 
[30203] were (250) 
[30204] groping, (853) 
[30205] and (632) 
[30206] I (925) 
[30207] found (396) 
[30208] my (521) 
[30209] attention (258) 
[30210] wander (156) 
[30211] so (456) 
[30212] continually (545) 
[30213] from (361) 
[30214] the (84) 
[30215] action (36) 
[30216] to (886) 
[30217] the (629) 
[30218] fact, (499) 
[30219] that (2) 
[30220] I (44) 
[30221] at (759) 
[30222] last (230) 
[30223] flung (446) 
[30224] it (122) 
[30225] across (903) 
[30226] the (104) 
[30227] room (998) 
[30228] and (246) 
[30229] gave (337) 
[30230] myself (518) 
[30231] up (664) 
[30232] entirely (927) 
[30233] to (296) 
[30234] a (488) 
[30235] consideration (246) 
[30236] of (143) 
[30237] the (647) 
[30238] events (503) 
[30239] of (88) 
[30240] the (404) 
[30241] day (498) 
[30242] Supposing (828) 
[30243] that (458) 
[30244] this (873) 
[30245] unhappy (875) 
[30246] young (318) 
[30247] man (956) 
[30248] s (289) 
[30249] story (266) 
[30250] were (668) 
[30251] absolutely (555) 
[30252] true, (66) 
[30253] then (206) 
[30254] what (44) 
[30255] hellish (424) 
[30256] thing, (961) 
[30257] what (481) 
[30258] absolutely (634) 
[30259] unforeseen (481) 
[30260] and (753) 
[30261] extraordinary (556) 
[30262] calamity (45) 
[30263] could (264) 
[30264] have (361) 
[30265] occurred (950) 
[30266] between (140) 
[30267] the (348) 
[30268] time (79) 
[30269] when (420) 
[30270] he (41) 
[30271] parted (213) 
[30272] from (380) 
[30273] his (641) 
[30274] father, (576) 
[30275] and (711) 
[30276] the (434) 
[30277] moment (416) 
[30278] when, (719) 
[30279] drawn (187) 
[30280] back (365) 
[30281] by (552) 
[30282] his (553) 
[30283] screams, (540) 
[30284] he (424) 
[30285] rushed (746) 
[30286] into (703) 
[30287] the (173) 
[30288] glade? (408) 
[30289] It (420) 
[30290] was (125) 
[30291] something (141) 
[30292] terrible (681) 
[30293] and (692) 
[30294] deadly (157) 
[30295] What (344) 
[30296] could (531) 
[30297] it (730) 
[30298] be? (178) 
[30299] Might (381) 
[30300] not (227) 
[30301] the (847) 
[30302] nature (454) 
[30303] of (842) 
[30304] the (871) 
[30305] injuries (546) 
[30306] reveal (863) 
[30307] something (527) 
[30308] to (716) 
[30309] my (684) 
[30310] medical (994) 
[30311] instincts? (209) 
[30312] I (674) 
[30313] rang (389) 
[30314] the (214) 
[30315] bell (347) 
[30316] and (727) 
[30317] called (726) 
[30318] for (310) 
[30319] the (377) 
[30320] weekly (292) 
[30321] county (936) 
[30322] paper, (7) 
[30323] which (843) 
[30324] contained (519) 
[30325] a (777) 
[30326] verbatim (118) 
[30327] account (582) 
[30328] of (237) 
[30329] the (60) 
[30330] inquest (480) 
[30331] In (231) 
[30332] the (54) 
[30333] surgeon (639) 
[30334] s (790) 
[30335] deposition (227) 
[30336] it (749) 
[30337] was (411) 
[30338] stated (812) 
[30339] that (676) 
[30340] the (3) 
[30341] posterior (877) 
[30342] third (219) 
[30343] of (701) 
[30344] the (114) 
[30345] left (439) 
[30346] parietal (517) 
[30347] bone (927) 
[30348] and (330) 
[30349] the (102) 
[30350] left (945) 
[30351] half (269) 
[30352] of (637) 
[30353] the (5) 
[30354] occipital (792) 
[30355] bone (75) 
[30356] had (587) 
[30357] been (821) 
[30358] shattered (100) 
[30359] by (328) 
[30360] a (484) 
[30361] heavy (884) 
[30362] blow (692) 
[30363] from (738) 
[30364] a (994) 
[30365] blunt (769) 
[30366] weapon (834) 
[30367] I (937) 
[30368] marked (492) 
[30369] the (255) 
[30370] spot (537) 
[30371] upon (234) 
[30372] my (414) 
[30373] own (776) 
[30374] head (489) 
[30375] Clearly (55) 
[30376] such (895) 
[30377] a (624) 
[30378] blow (528) 
[30379] must (547) 
[30380] have (810) 
[30381] been (301) 
[30382] struck (709) 
[30383] from (836) 
[30384] behind (245) 
[30385] That (99) 
[30386] was (722) 
[30387] to (132) 
[30388] some (359) 
[30389] extent (732) 
[30390] in (531) 
[30391] favour (245) 
[30392] of (845) 
[30393] the (501) 
[30394] accused, (962) 
[30395] as (635) 
[30396] when (63) 
[30397] seen (51) 
[30398] quarrelling (929) 
[30399] he (512) 
[30400] was (416) 
[30401] face (27) 
[30402] to (130) 
[30403] face (90) 
[30404] with (293) 
[30405] his (692) 
[30406] father (150) 
[30407] Still, (838) 
[30408] it (199) 
[30409] did (991) 
[30410] not (988) 
[30411] go (23) 
[30412] for (546) 
[30413] very (444) 
[30414] much, (852) 
[30415] for (826) 
[30416] the (76) 
[30417] older (902) 
[30418] man (19) 
[30419] might (888) 
[30420] have (176) 
[30421] turned (686) 
[30422] his (525) 
[30423] back (876) 
[30424] before (734) 
[30425] the (100) 
[30426] blow (296) 
[30427] fell (832) 
[30428] Still, (502) 
[30429] it (255) 
[30430] might (885) 
[30431] be (78) 
[30432] worth (554) 
[30433] while (881) 
[30434] to (292) 
[30435] call (960) 
[30436] Holmes (541) 
[30437] attention (296) 
[30438] to (415) 
[30439] it (391) 
[30440] Then (610) 
[30441] there (188) 
[30442] was (794) 
[30443] the (741) 
[30444] peculiar (158) 
[30445] dying (158) 
[30446] reference (553) 
[30447] to (785) 
[30448] a (797) 
[30449] rat (342) 
[30450] What (297) 
[30451] could (767) 
[30452] that (179) 
[30453] mean? (831) 
[30454] It (548) 
[30455] could (618) 
[30456] not (830) 
[30457] be (54) 
[30458] delirium (116) 
[30459] A (194) 
[30460] man (262) 
[30461] dying (140) 
[30462] from (90) 
[30463] a (840) 
[30464] sudden (534) 
[30465] blow (634) 
[30466] does (77) 
[30467] not (511) 
[30468] commonly (107) 
[30469] become (825) 
[30470] delirious (975) 
[30471] No, (979) 
[30472] it (325) 
[30473] was (375) 
[30474] more (297) 
[30475] likely (213) 
[30476] to (786) 
[30477] be (345) 
[30478] an (941) 
[30479] attempt (826) 
[30480] to (619) 
[30481] explain (800) 
[30482] how (898) 
[30483] he (73) 
[30484] met (185) 
[30485] his (863) 
[30486] fate (248) 
[30487] But (290) 
[30488] what (740) 
[30489] could (836) 
[30490] it (663) 
[30491] indicate? (958) 
[30492] I (283) 
[30493] cudgelled (942) 
[30494] my (922) 
[30495] brains (714) 
[30496] to (0) 
[30497] find (738) 
[30498] some (92) 
[30499] possible (614) 
[30500] explanation (84) 
[30501] And (850) 
[30502] then (480) 
[30503] the (633) 
[30504] incident (426) 
[30505] of (232) 
[30506] the (793) 
[30507] grey (247) 
[30508] cloth (7) 
[30509] seen (488) 
[30510] by (766) 
[30511] young (689) 
[30512] McCarthy (447) 
[30513] If (224) 
[30514] that (137) 
[30515] were (867) 
[30516] true (595) 
[30517] the (859) 
[30518] murderer (370) 
[30519] must (929) 
[30520] have (351) 
[30521] dropped (319) 
[30522] some (124) 
[30523] part (998) 
[30524] of (339) 
[30525] his (493) 
[30526] dress, (437) 
[30527] presumably (650) 
[30528] his (185) 
[30529] overcoat, (188) 
[30530] in (622) 
[30531] his (91) 
[30532] flight, (212) 
[30533] and (904) 
[30534] must (847) 
[30535] have (50) 
[30536] had (762) 
[30537] the (567) 
[30538] hardihood (674) 
[30539] to (474) 
[30540] return (191) 
[30541] and (602) 
[30542] to (85) 
[30543] carry (981) 
[30544] it (677) 
[30545] away (794) 
[30546] at (334) 
[30547] the (236) 
[30548] instant (58) 
[30549] when (986) 
[30550] the (576) 
[30551] son (861) 
[30552] was (56) 
[30553] kneeling (449) 
[30554] with (267) 
[30555] his (332) 
[30556] back (389) 
[30557] turned (515) 
[30558] not (242) 
[30559] a (57) 
[30560] dozen (285) 
[30561] paces (365) 
[30562] off (592) 
[30563] What (913) 
[30564] a (344) 
[30565] tissue (10) 
[30566] of (300) 
[30567] mysteries (136) 
[30568] and (688) 
[30569] improbabilities (621) 
[30570] the (632) 
[30571] whole (306) 
[30572] thing (126) 
[30573] was (430) 
[30574] I (254) 
[30575] did (456) 
[30576] not (761) 
[30577] wonder (135) 
[30578] at (307) 
[30579] Lestrade (575) 
[30580] s (799) 
[30581] opinion, (742) 
[30582] and (332) 
[30583] yet (573) 
[30584] I (932) 
[30585] had (970) 
[30586] so (219) 
[30587] much (694) 
[30588] faith (858) 
[30589] in (947) 
[30590] Sherlock (109) 
[30591] Holmes (725) 
[30592] insight (570) 
[30593] that (122) 
[30594] I (183) 
[30595] could (696) 
[30596] not (970) 
[30597] lose (454) 
[30598] hope (121) 
[30599] as (796) 
[30600] long (948) 
[30601] as (890) 
[30602] every (916) 
[30603] fresh (772) 
[30604] fact (649) 
[30605] seemed (692) 
[30606] to (615) 
[30607] strengthen (970) 
[30608] his (623) 
[30609] conviction (847) 
[30610] of (84) 
[30611] young (782) 
[30612] McCarthy (759) 
[30613] s (895) 
[30614] innocence (312) 
[30615] It (225) 
[30616] was (478) 
[30617] late (103) 
[30618] before (256) 
[30619] Sherlock (763) 
[30620] Holmes (495) 
[30621] returned (346) 
[30622] He (590) 
[30623] came (672) 
[30624] back (737) 
[30625] alone, (987) 
[30626] for (734) 
[30627] Lestrade (34) 
[30628] was (355) 
[30629] staying (879) 
[30630] in (651) 
[30631] lodgings (910) 
[30632] in (62) 
[30633] the (620) 
[30634] town (892)

[30988] wife (47)

[31010] point (227) 
[31011] It (83) 
[31012] is (782) 
[31013] of (562) 
[31014] importance (482)

[31016] has (609) 
[31017] come (74) 
[31018] out (511) 
[31019] of (180) 
[31020] evil, (398) 
[31021] however, (18) 
[31022] for (780) 
[31023] the (111) 
[31024] barmaid, (358) 
[31025] finding (49) 
[31026] from (346) 
[31027] the (237) 
[31028] papers (10) 
[31029] that (559) 
[31030] he (47)

[31032] in (998) 
[31033] serious (112) 
[31034] trouble (329) 
[31035] and (754) 
[31036] likely (973) 
[31037] to (531) 
[31038] be (405) 
[31039] hanged, (779) 
[31040] has (917)

[31042] him (242) 
[31043] over (477) 
[31044] utterly (306) 
[31045] and (742) 
[31046] has (85) 
[31047] written (770) 
[31048] to (330) 
[31049] him (519) 
[31050] to (992) 
[31051] say (662) 
[31052] that (516)

[31068] tie (131) 
[31069] between (505) 
[31070] them (772)

[31072] think (983)

[31074] that (590)

[31076] of (223) 
[31077] news (139)

[31080] young (759) 
[31081] McCarthy (543) 
[31082] for (185) 
[31083] all (758) 
[31084] that (53) 
[31085] he (717) 
[31086] has (798) 
[31087] suffered (269)

[31093] innocent, (428) 
[31094] who (923)

[31096] done (818) 
[31097] it?" (103) 
[31098] "Ah (245)

[31149] second (316)

[31151] that (30) 
[31152] the (742) 
[31153] murdered (326) 
[31154] man (168) 
[31155] was (588) 
[31156] heard (67) 
[31157] to (366) 
[31158] cry (300) 
[31159] Cooee (846) 
[31160] before (376) 
[31161] he (321) 
[31162] knew (511) 
[31163] that (788) 
[31164] his (659) 
[31165] son (197) 
[31166] had (400) 
[31167] returned (93) 
[31168] Those (632) 
[31169] are (974) 
[31170] the (237) 
[31171] crucial (324) 
[31172] points (871) 
[31173] upon (116) 
[31174] which (569) 
[31175] the (623) 
[31176] case (750) 
[31177] depends (697) 
[31178] And (243) 
[31179] now (208) 
[31180] let (840) 
[31181] us (857) 
[31182] talk (525)

[31187] you (964) 
[31188] please, (538) 
[31189] and (568) 
[31190] we (306) 
[31191] shall (276) 
[31192] leave (875) 
[31193] all (660) 
[31194] minor (760) 
[31195] matters (626) 
[31196] until (517) 
[31197] to (814) 
[31198] morrow (496) 
[31199] " (640) 
[31200] There (134) 
[31201] was (906) 
[31202] no (346) 
[31203] rain, (189) 
[31204] as (159) 
[31205] Holmes (408) 
[31206] had (782) 
[31207] foretold, (569) 
[31208] and (652) 
[31209] the (615) 
[31210] morning (223) 
[31211] broke (884) 
[31212] bright (357) 
[31213] and (366) 
[31214] cloudless (871) 
[31215] At (315)

[31217] o (71) 
[31218] clock (361) 
[31219] Lestrade (890) 
[31220] called (136) 
[31221] for (5) 
[31222] us (933) 
[31223] with (843) 
[31224] the (540) 
[31225] carriage, (108) 
[31226] and (270) 
[31227] we (134) 
[31228] set (95) 
[31229] off (971) 
[31230] for (742) 
[31231] Hatherley (615) 
[31232] Farm (723) 
[31233] and (889) 
[31234] the (757) 
[31235] Boscombe (983) 
[31236] Pool (236) 
[31237] "There (588) 
[31238] is (813) 
[31239] serious (666)

[31241] this (94) 
[31242] morning," (834) 
[31243] Lestrade (872) 
[31244] observed (612) 
[31245] "It (768) 
[31246] is (576)

[31251] of (593) 
[31252] the (797) 
[31253] Hall, (671) 
[31254] is (127) 
[31255] so (52) 
[31256] ill (76) 
[31257] that (836) 
[31258] his (257) 
[31259] life (873) 
[31260] is (365) 
[31261] despaired (777)

[31264] "An (927) 
[31265] elderly (982) 
[31266] man, (110) 
[31267] I (559) 
[31268] presume?" (100) 
[31269] said (435) 
[31270] Holmes (886) 
[31271] "About (638) 
[31272] sixty; (922) 
[31273] but (229) 
[31274] his (934) 
[31275] constitution (155) 
[31276] has (49) 
[31277] been (596) 
[31278] shattered (133) 
[31279] by (754) 
[31280] his (982) 
[31281] life (63) 
[31282] abroad, (578) 
[31283] and (569) 
[31284] he (12)

[31291] some (186) 
[31292] time (464) 
[31293] This (230) 
[31294] business (144) 
[31295] has (424) 
[31296] had (746) 
[31297] a (282) 
[31298] very (871) 
[31299] bad (584) 
[31300] effect (609) 
[31301] upon (110) 
[31302] him (604) 
[31303] He (252) 
[31304] was (733) 
[31305] an (661) 
[31306] old (332) 
[31307] friend (33) 
[31308] of (498) 
[31309] McCarthy (188) 
[31310] s, (482) 
[31311] and, (891) 
[31312] I (723) 
[31313] may (149) 
[31314] add, (536)

[31321] I (956) 
[31322] have (785) 
[31323] learned (692) 
[31324] that (37) 
[31325] he (577) 
[31326] gave (356) 
[31327] him (651)

[31333] "Indeed (645) 
[31334] That (738) 
[31335] is (415) 
[31336] interesting," (840) 
[31337] said (25) 
[31338] Holmes (150) 
[31339] "Oh, (997) 
[31340] yes (199)

[31360] "Really (415) 
[31361] Does (130) 
[31362] it (305) 
[31363] not (803) 
[31364] strike (667) 
[31365] you (982) 
[31366] as (74) 
[31367] a (280) 
[31368] little (371)

[31372] McCarthy, (85) 
[31373] who (386) 
[31374] appears (310) 
[31375] to (142) 
[31376] have (365) 
[31377] had (657) 
[31378] little (444) 
[31379] of (873)

[31390] Turner, (889)

[31392] still (131) 
[31393] talk (521) 
[31394] of (44) 
[31395] marrying (188) 
[31396] his (164) 
[31397] son (532)

[31401] daughter, (371) 
[31402] who (171) 
[31403] is, (916) 
[31404] presumably, (570) 
[31405] heiress (23) 
[31406] to (51) 
[31407] the (536) 
[31408] estate, (621)

[31412] such (272) 
[31413] a (712) 
[31414] very (81) 
[31415] cocksure (403) 
[31416] manner, (740)

[31418] if (422) 
[31419] it (320) 
[31420] were (306) 
[31421] merely (633) 
[31422] a (993) 
[31423] case (325) 
[31424] of (71) 
[31425] a (639) 
[31426] proposal (162) 
[31427] and (626) 
[31428] all (278) 
[31429] else (763) 
[31430] would (461) 
[31431] follow? (158) 
[31432] It (804) 
[31433] is (552) 
[31434] the (47) 
[31435] more (952) 
[31436] strange, (561) 
[31437] since (359) 
[31438] we (341) 
[31439] know (587) 
[31440] that (455) 
[31441] Turner (602) 
[31442] himself (466) 
[31443] was (933) 
[31444] averse (878) 
[31445] to (367) 
[31446] the (952) 
[31447] idea (890) 
[31448] The (824) 
[31449] daughter (780) 
[31450] told (705) 
[31451] us (251) 
[31452] as (715) 
[31453] much (404) 
[31454] Do (334) 
[31455] you (789) 
[31456] not (514) 
[31457] deduce (351) 
[31458] something (353) 
[31459] from (863) 
[31460] that?" (949) 
[31461] "We (377) 
[31462] have (459) 
[31463] got (802) 
[31464] to (611) 
[31465] the (204) 
[31466] deductions (21) 
[31467] and (815) 
[31468] the (865) 
[31469] inferences," (887) 
[31470] said (976) 
[31471] Lestrade, (158) 
[31472] winking (371) 
[31473] at (664) 
[31474] me (852) 
[31475] "I (303) 
[31476] find (317) 
[31477] it (262) 
[31478] hard (16) 
[31479] enough (27) 
[31480] to (258) 
[31481] tackle (377) 
[31482] facts, (549) 
[31483] Holmes, (983) 
[31484] without (316) 
[31485] flying (964) 
[31486] away (783) 
[31487] after (307) 
[31488] theories (615) 
[31489] and (728) 
[31490] fancies (406)

[31492] "You (104) 
[31493] are (593) 
[31494] right," (394) 
[31495] said (256) 
[31496] Holmes (655) 
[31497] demurely; (139) 
[31498] "you (14) 
[31499] do (922) 
[31500] find (693) 
[31501] it (431) 
[31502] very (964)

[31509] "Anyhow, (650) 
[31510] I (328) 
[31511] have (309) 
[31512] grasped (249) 
[31513] one (659) 
[31514] fact (880)

[31516] you (40)

[31526] replied (174) 
[31527] Lestrade (515) 
[31528] with (444) 
[31529] some (997) 
[31530] warmth (352) 
[31531] "And (719) 
[31532] that (250) 
[31533] is (612)

[31535] "That (83) 
[31536] McCarthy (425)

[31556] "Well, (852)

[31561] thing (746) 
[31562] than (912) 
[31563] fog," (578) 
[31564] said (511) 
[31565] Holmes, (71) 
[31566] laughing (576) 
[31567] "But (463) 
[31568] I (847)

[31570] very (21) 
[31571] much (884) 
[31572] mistaken (33)

[31654] the (798) 
[31655] time (7) 
[31656] of (11) 
[31657] his (733) 
[31658] death, (644) 
[31659] and (9) 
[31660] also (693) 
[31661] a (141) 
[31662] pair (382) 
[31663] of (282) 
[31664] the (476) 
[31665] son (595) 
[31666] s, (474) 
[31667] though (549) 
[31668] not (406) 
[31669] the (809) 
[31670] pair (9) 
[31671] which (204) 
[31672] he (862) 
[31673] had (545) 
[31674] then (445) 
[31675] had (925) 
[31676] Having (793) 
[31677] measured (550) 
[31678] these (543) 
[31679] very (632) 
[31680] carefully (302) 
[31681] from (349) 
[31682] seven (910) 
[31683] or (207) 
[31684] eight (626) 
[31685] different (447) 
[31686] points, (556) 
[31687] Holmes (530) 
[31688] desired (727) 
[31689] to (746)

[31694] court (200) 
[31695] yard, (811) 
[31696] from (337) 
[31697] which (598) 
[31698] we (152) 
[31699] all (355) 
[31700] followed (555) 
[31701] the (519) 
[31702] winding (932) 
[31703] track (210) 
[31704] which (531) 
[31705] led (756) 
[31706] to (100) 
[31707] Boscombe (983) 
[31708] Pool (432) 
[31709] Sherlock (232) 
[31710] Holmes (425) 
[31711] was (801) 
[31712] transformed (808) 
[31713] when (565) 
[31714] he (84) 
[31715] was (831) 
[31716] hot (489) 
[31717] upon (715) 
[31718] such (790) 
[31719] a (968) 
[31720] scent (41) 
[31721] as (93) 
[31722] this (743) 
[31723] Men (952) 
[31724] who (491) 
[31725] had (812) 
[31726] only (297) 
[31727] known (419) 
[31728] the (777) 
[31729] quiet (554) 
[31730] thinker (868) 
[31731] and (347) 
[31732] logician (304) 
[31733] of (157) 
[31734] Baker (146) 
[31735] Street (499) 
[31736] would (576) 
[31737] have (717) 
[31738] failed (70) 
[31739] to (410) 
[31740] recognise (713) 
[31741] him (514) 
[31742] His (480) 
[31743] face (201) 
[31744] flushed (680) 
[31745] and (598) 
[31746] darkened (870) 
[31747] His (420) 
[31748] brows (775) 
[31749] were (154) 
[31750] drawn (583) 
[31751] into (4) 
[31752] two (247) 
[31753] hard (189) 
[31754] black (156) 
[31755] lines, (136) 
[31756] while (313) 
[31757] his (848) 
[31758] eyes (703) 
[31759] shone (600) 
[31760] out (205) 
[31761] from (308) 
[31762] beneath (790) 
[31763] them (764) 
[31764] with (131) 
[31765] a (605) 
[31766] steely (663) 
[31767] glitter (657) 
[31768] His (912) 
[31769] face (484) 
[31770] was (83) 
[31771] bent (724) 
[31772] downward, (403) 
[31773] his (320) 
[31774] shoulders (379) 
[31775] bowed, (52) 
[31776] his (100) 
[31777] lips (7) 
[31778] compressed, (194) 
[31779] and (52) 
[31780] the (942) 
[31781] veins (718) 
[31782] stood (727) 
[31783] out (180) 
[31784] like (729) 
[31785] whipcord (309) 
[31786] in (816) 
[31787] his (760) 
[31788] long, (625) 
[31789] sinewy (17) 
[31790] neck (649) 
[31791] His (842) 
[31792] nostrils (488) 
[31793] seemed (650) 
[31794] to (55) 
[31795] dilate (362) 
[31796] with (772) 
[31797] a (936) 
[31798] purely (63) 
[31799] animal (37) 
[31800] lust (847) 
[31801] for (209) 
[31802] the (162) 
[31803] chase, (461) 
[31804] and (727) 
[31805] his (398) 
[31806] mind (996) 
[31807] was (231) 
[31808] so (921) 
[31809] absolutely (680) 
[31810] concentrated (361) 
[31811] upon (604) 
[31812] the (101) 
[31813] matter (611) 
[31814] before (451) 
[31815] him (933) 
[31816] that (24) 
[31817] a (186) 
[31818] question (224) 
[31819] or (125) 
[31820] remark (269) 
[31821] fell (316) 
[31822] unheeded (13) 
[31823] upon (732) 
[31824] his (542) 
[31825] ears, (402) 
[31826] or, (953) 
[31827] at (976) 
[31828] the (591) 
[31829] most, (902) 
[31830] only (823) 
[31831] provoked (101) 
[31832] a (934) 
[31833] quick, (612) 
[31834] impatient (113) 
[31835] snarl (967) 
[31836] in (986) 
[31837] reply (304) 
[31838] Swiftly (482) 
[31839] and (363) 
[31840] silently (778) 
[31841] he (432) 
[31842] made (439) 
[31843] his (464) 
[31844] way (135) 
[31845] along (630) 
[31846] the (258) 
[31847] track (73) 
[31848] which (166) 
[31849] ran (402) 
[31850] through (604) 
[31851] the (545) 
[31852] meadows, (403) 
[31853] and (373) 
[31854] so (612) 
[31855] by (462) 
[31856] way (776) 
[31857] of (783) 
[31858] the (737) 
[31859] woods (33) 
[31860] to (678) 
[31861] the (772) 
[31862] Boscombe (180) 
[31863] Pool (974) 
[31864] It (209) 
[31865] was (792) 
[31866] damp, (131) 
[31867] marshy (52) 
[31868] ground, (901) 
[31869] as (44) 
[31870] is (29) 
[31871] all (879) 
[31872] that (7) 
[31873] district, (498) 
[31874] and (321) 
[31875] there (978) 
[31876] were (898) 
[31877] marks (964) 
[31878] of (751) 
[31879] many (833) 
[31880] feet, (316) 
[31881] both (155) 
[31882] upon (267) 
[31883] the (322) 
[31884] path (468) 
[31885] and (828) 
[31886] amid (510) 
[31887] the (545) 
[31888] short (748) 
[31889] grass (736) 
[31890] which (476) 
[31891] bounded (664) 
[31892] it (805) 
[31893] on (604) 
[31894] either (586) 
[31895] side (887) 
[31896] Sometimes (419) 
[31897] Holmes (180) 
[31898] would (200) 
[31899] hurry (293) 
[31900] on, (378) 
[31901] sometimes (999) 
[31902] stop (71) 
[31903] dead, (761) 
[31904] and (903) 
[31905] once (653) 
[31906] he (909) 
[31907] made (946) 
[31908] quite (741) 
[31909] a (782) 
[31910] little (133) 
[31911] detour (620) 
[31912] into (111) 
[31913] the (446) 
[31914] meadow (622) 
[31915] Lestrade (950) 
[31916] and (726) 
[31917] I (713) 
[31918] walked (185) 
[31919] behind (490) 
[31920] him, (805) 
[31921] the (783) 
[31922] detective (166) 
[31923] indifferent (714) 
[31924] and (350) 
[31925] contemptuous, (981) 
[31926] while (484) 
[31927] I (371) 
[31928] watched (636) 
[31929] my (945) 
[31930] friend (490) 
[31931] with (167) 
[31932] the (743) 
[31933] interest (613) 
[31934] which (632) 
[31935] sprang (448) 
[31936] from (620) 
[31937] the (267) 
[31938] conviction (231) 
[31939] that (287) 
[31940] every (913) 
[31941] one (954) 
[31942] of (494) 
[31943] his (625) 
[31944] actions (606) 
[31945] was (583) 
[31946] directed (270) 
[31947] towards (24) 
[31948] a (871) 
[31949] definite (815) 
[31950] end (855) 
[31951] The (339) 
[31952] Boscombe (652) 
[31953] Pool, (404) 
[31954] which (716) 
[31955] is (508) 
[31956] a (215) 
[31957] little (223) 
[31958] reed (446) 
[31959] girt (358) 
[31960] sheet (344) 
[31961] of (156) 
[31962] water (22) 
[31963] some (716) 
[31964] fifty (962) 
[31965] yards (119) 
[31966] across, (5) 
[31967] is (32) 
[31968] situated (30) 
[31969] at (592) 
[31970] the (803) 
[31971] boundary (909) 
[31972] between (619) 
[31973] the (623) 
[31974] Hatherley (585) 
[31975] Farm (238) 
[31976] and (334) 
[31977] the (919) 
[31978] private (176) 
[31979] park (406) 
[31980] of (578) 
[31981] the (170) 
[31982] wealthy (965) 
[31983] Mr (251) 
[31984] Turner (261) 
[31985] Above (213) 
[31986] the (862) 
[31987] woods (116) 
[31988] which (665) 
[31989] lined (832) 
[31990] it (358) 
[31991] upon (192) 
[31992] the (903) 
[31993] farther (951) 
[31994] side (325) 
[31995] we (577) 
[31996] could (432) 
[31997] see (851) 
[31998] the (25) 
[31999] red, (593) 
[32000] jutting (283) 
[32001] pinnacles (476) 
[32002] which (262) 
[32003] marked (613) 
[32004] the (809) 
[32005] site (95) 
[32006] of (924) 
[32007] the (145) 
[32008] rich (218) 
[32009] landowner (198)

[32011] dwelling (966) 
[32012] On (288) 
[32013] the (977) 
[32014] Hatherley (491) 
[32015] side (783) 
[32016] of (689) 
[32017] the (689) 
[32018] pool (137) 
[32019] the (319) 
[32020] woods (119) 
[32021] grew (243) 
[32022] very (390) 
[32023] thick, (977) 
[32024] and (767) 
[32025] there (479) 
[32026] was (995) 
[32027] a (689) 
[32028] narrow (925) 
[32029] belt (292) 
[32030] of (187) 
[32031] sodden (2) 
[32032] grass (164) 
[32033] twenty (330) 
[32034] paces (939) 
[32035] across (691) 
[32036] between (473) 
[32037] the (988) 
[32038] edge (922) 
[32039] of (86) 
[32040] the (285) 
[32041] trees (369) 
[32042] and (265) 
[32043] the (434) 
[32044] reeds (110) 
[32045] which (821) 
[32046] lined (159) 
[32047] the (534) 
[32048] lake (554) 
[32049] Lestrade (722) 
[32050] showed (444) 
[32051] us (43) 
[32052] the (972) 
[32053] exact (539) 
[32054] spot (242) 
[32055] at (726) 
[32056] which (67) 
[32057] the (227) 
[32058] body (806) 
[32059] had (189) 
[32060] been (249) 
[32061] found, (682) 
[32062] and, (125) 
[32063] indeed, (917) 
[32064] so (179) 
[32065] moist (675) 
[32066] was (240) 
[32067] the (618) 
[32068] ground, (800) 
[32069] that (508) 
[32070] I (744) 
[32071] could (635) 
[32072] plainly (852) 
[32073] see (893) 
[32074] the (454) 
[32075] traces (320) 
[32076] which (208) 
[32077] had (610) 
[32078] been (288) 
[32079] left (685) 
[32080] by (903) 
[32081] the (117) 
[32082] fall (763) 
[32083] of (443) 
[32084] the (533) 
[32085] stricken (847) 
[32086] man (993) 
[32087] To (844) 
[32088] Holmes, (401) 
[32089] as (450) 
[32090] I (895) 
[32091] could (722) 
[32092] see (750) 
[32093] by (238) 
[32094] his (244) 
[32095] eager (891) 
[32096] face (583) 
[32097] and (296) 
[32098] peering (582) 
[32099] eyes, (436) 
[32100] very (214) 
[32101] many (818) 
[32102] other (579) 
[32103] things (64) 
[32104] were (980) 
[32105] to (302) 
[32106] be (882) 
[32107] read (117) 
[32108] upon (163) 
[32109] the (178) 
[32110] trampled (321) 
[32111] grass (933) 
[32112] He (552) 
[32113] ran (611) 
[32114] round, (237) 
[32115] like (329) 
[32116] a (65) 
[32117] dog (399) 
[32118] who (946) 
[32119] is (737) 
[32120] picking (928) 
[32121] up (608) 
[32122] a (477) 
[32123] scent, (670) 
[32124] and (506) 
[32125] then (114) 
[32126] turned (642) 
[32127] upon (892) 
[32128] my (24) 
[32129] companion (121) 
[32130] "What (581) 
[32131] did (59) 
[32132] you (781) 
[32133] go (371) 
[32134] into (102) 
[32135] the (669) 
[32136] pool (836) 
[32137] for?" (569) 
[32138] he (264) 
[32139] asked (764) 
[32140] "I (270) 
[32141] fished (236) 
[32142] about (98) 
[32143] with (308) 
[32144] a (966) 
[32145] rake (922) 
[32146] I (948) 
[32147] thought (519) 
[32148] there (969) 
[32149] might (500) 
[32150] be (812) 
[32151] some (66) 
[32152] weapon (777) 
[32153] or (203) 
[32154] other (279) 
[32155] trace (795) 
[32156] But (142) 
[32157] how (70) 
[32158] on (495) 
[32159] earth (480)

[32461] up (208)

[32479] the (393) 
[32480] ground (483) 
[32481] but (740) 
[32482] even (999) 
[32483] the (429) 
[32484] bark (10) 
[32485] of (756) 
[32486] the (730) 
[32487] tree (175) 
[32488] as (206) 
[32489] far (810) 
[32490] as (694) 
[32491] he (853) 
[32492] could (470) 
[32493] reach (216) 
[32494] A (154) 
[32495] jagged (878) 
[32496] stone (675)

[32498] lying (823) 
[32499] among (588)

[32502] and (512) 
[32503] this (734) 
[32504] also (24) 
[32505] he (306) 
[32506] carefully (378) 
[32507] examined (963) 
[32508] and (810) 
[32509] retained (403) 
[32510] Then (639) 
[32511] he (275) 
[32512] followed (606) 
[32513] a (863) 
[32514] pathway (74) 
[32515] through (434) 
[32516] the (788) 
[32517] wood (343) 
[32518] until (525) 
[32519] he (661) 
[32520] came (895) 
[32521] to (952) 
[32522] the (42) 
[32523] highroad, (877) 
[32524] where (951) 
[32525] all (196) 
[32526] traces (43)

[33810] and (850) 
[33811] bowed (282)

[33814] the (734)

[33858] dignity (137) 
[33859] and (648) 
[33860] power (518) 
[33861] to (64) 
[33862] his (272)

[33984] the (462)

[34458] the (404) 
[34459] name (359) 
[34460] I (80) 
[34461] went (904) 
[34462] under, (449) 
[34463] and (668) 
[34464] our (655) 
[34465] party (16)

[34467] still (229) 
[34468] remembered (424)

[34470] the (907) 
[34471] colony (76)

[34473] the (238) 
[34474] Ballarat (996) 
[34475] Gang (628) 
[34476] "One (276) 
[34477] day (614) 
[34478] a (638) 
[34479] gold (39) 
[34480] convoy (33) 
[34481] came (180) 
[34482] down (763) 
[34483] from (32) 
[34484] Ballarat (475) 
[34485] to (403) 
[34486] Melbourne, (725) 
[34487] and (636) 
[34488] we (475) 
[34489] lay (462) 
[34490] in (606) 
[34491] wait (940) 
[34492] for (558) 
[34493] it (971) 
[34494] and (683) 
[34495] attacked (201) 
[34496] it (933) 
[34497] There (278) 
[34498] were (605) 
[34499] six (274) 
[34500] troopers (371) 
[34501] and (175) 
[34502] six (846) 
[34503] of (214) 
[34504] us, (270) 
[34505] so (6) 
[34506] it (765) 
[34507] was (349) 
[34508] a (717) 
[34509] close (208) 
[34510] thing, (145) 
[34511] but (671) 
[34512] we (411) 
[34513] emptied (338) 
[34514] four (173) 
[34515] of (374) 
[34516] their (110) 
[34517] saddles (678) 
[34518] at (196) 
[34519] the (950) 
[34520] first (691) 
[34521] volley (785) 
[34522] Three (566) 
[34523] of (776) 
[34524] our (171) 
[34525] boys (496) 
[34526] were (549) 
[34527] killed, (954) 
[34528] however, (881) 
[34529] before (443) 
[34530] we (238) 
[34531] got (769) 
[34532] the (715) 
[34533] swag (290) 
[34534] I (147) 
[34535] put (195) 
[34536] my (994) 
[34537] pistol (261) 
[34538] to (215) 
[34539] the (281) 
[34540] head (69) 
[34541] of (152) 
[34542] the (681) 
[34543] wagon (335) 
[34544] driver, (992) 
[34545] who (941) 
[34546] was (943) 
[34547] this (731) 
[34548] very (319) 
[34549] man (297) 
[34550] McCarthy (818) 
[34551] I (773) 
[34552] wish (383) 
[34553] to (155) 
[34554] the (700) 
[34555] Lord (999) 
[34556] that (755) 
[34557] I (520) 
[34558] had (709) 
[34559] shot (503) 
[34560] him (691) 
[34561] then, (457) 
[34562] but (153) 
[34563] I (517) 
[34564] spared (544) 
[34565] him, (950) 
[34566] though (263) 
[34567] I (597) 
[34568] saw (769) 
[34569] his (394) 
[34570] wicked (558) 
[34571] little (772) 
[34572] eyes (540) 
[34573] fixed (212) 
[34574] on (22) 
[34575] my (810) 
[34576] face, (994) 
[34577] as (820) 
[34578] though (344) 
[34579] to (500) 
[34580] remember (443) 
[34581] every (175) 
[34582] feature (632) 
[34583] We (99) 
[34584] got (649) 
[34585] away (628) 
[34586] with (124) 
[34587] the (701) 
[34588] gold, (831) 
[34589] became (216) 
[34590] wealthy (986) 
[34591] men, (811) 
[34592] and (502) 
[34593] made (490) 
[34594] our (901) 
[34595] way (924) 
[34596] over (475) 
[34597] to (978) 
[34598] England (303) 
[34599] without (146) 
[34600] being (838) 
[34601] suspected (191) 
[34602] There (65) 
[34603] I (717) 
[34604] parted (390) 
[34605] from (690) 
[34606] my (850) 
[34607] old (811) 
[34608] pals (352) 
[34609] and (433) 
[34610] determined (982) 
[34611] to (551) 
[34612] settle (595) 
[34613] down (543) 
[34614] to (717) 
[34615] a (786) 
[34616] quiet (595) 
[34617] and (194) 
[34618] respectable (668) 
[34619] life (318) 
[34620] I (276) 
[34621] bought (100) 
[34622] this (501) 
[34623] estate, (325) 
[34624] which (251) 
[34625] chanced (693) 
[34626] to (290) 
[34627] be (398) 
[34628] in (79) 
[34629] the (671) 
[34630] market, (614) 
[34631] and (43) 
[34632] I (701) 
[34633] set (736) 
[34634] myself (518) 
[34635] to (589) 
[34636] do (733) 
[34637] a (377) 
[34638] little (35) 
[34639] good (911) 
[34640] with (57) 
[34641] my (272) 
[34642] money, (103) 
[34643] to (310) 
[34644] make (873) 
[34645] up (175) 
[34646] for (337) 
[34647] the (437) 
[34648] way (29) 
[34649] in (306) 
[34650] which (160) 
[34651] I (975) 
[34652] had (76) 
[34653] earned (682) 
[34654] it (358) 
[34655] I (325) 
[34656] married, (601) 
[34657] too, (506) 
[34658] and (404) 
[34659] though (566) 
[34660] my (340) 
[34661] wife (664) 
[34662] died (295) 
[34663] young (944) 
[34664] she (574) 
[34665] left (37) 
[34666] me (801) 
[34667] my (513) 
[34668] dear (481) 
[34669] little (715) 
[34670] Alice (669) 
[34671] Even (535) 
[34672] when (182) 
[34673] she (472) 
[34674] was (446) 
[34675] just (929) 
[34676] a (933) 
[34677] baby (28) 
[34678] her (502) 
[34679] wee (347) 
[34680] hand (828) 
[34681] seemed (212) 
[34682] to (300) 
[34683] lead (546) 
[34684] me (128) 
[34685] down (198) 
[34686] the (155) 
[34687] right (918) 
[34688] path (285) 
[34689] as (903) 
[34690] nothing (868) 
[34691] else (573) 
[34692] had (881) 
[34693] ever (792) 
[34694] done (399) 
[34695] In (745) 
[34696] a (625) 
[34697] word, (695) 
[34698] I (87) 
[34699] turned (269) 
[34700] over (932) 
[34701] a (670) 
[34702] new (932) 
[34703] leaf (4)

[34907] at (247) 
[34908] last (211) 
[34909] he (349) 
[34910] asked (126)

[34921] Alice (37)

[34940] be (899) 
[34941] in (745) 
[34942] weak (867) 
[34943] health, (387) 
[34944] it (855) 
[34945] seemed (47) 
[34946] a (356) 
[34947] fine (428) 
[34948] stroke (709) 
[34949] to (358) 
[34950] him (452) 
[34951] that (543) 
[34952] his (135) 
[34953] lad (282) 
[34954] should (294) 
[34955] step (894) 
[34956] into (301) 
[34957] the (582) 
[34958] whole (891) 
[34959] property (419) 
[34960] But (80) 
[34961] there (741) 
[34962] I (123) 
[34963] was (483) 
[34964] firm (35) 
[34965] I (769) 
[34966] would (458) 
[34967] not (873) 
[34968] have (319) 
[34969] his (237) 
[34970] cursed (126) 
[34971] stock (805) 
[34972] mixed (318) 
[34973] with (803) 
[34974] mine; (337) 
[34975] not (729) 
[34976] that (252) 
[34977] I (725) 
[34978] had (754) 
[34979] any (576) 
[34980] dislike (809) 
[34981] to (884) 
[34982] the (202) 
[34983] lad, (454) 
[34984] but (746) 
[34985] his (534) 
[34986] blood (394) 
[34987] was (959) 
[34988] in (208) 
[34989] him, (184) 
[34990] and (194) 
[34991] that (699) 
[34992] was (326) 
[34993] enough (91) 
[34994] I (465) 
[34995] stood (343) 
[34996] firm (443) 
[34997] McCarthy (142) 
[34998] threatened (669) 
[34999] I (714) 
[35000] braved (665) 
[35001] him (244) 
[35002] to (569) 
[35003] do (278) 
[35004] his (490) 
[35005] worst (337) 
[35006] We (400) 
[35007] were (230) 
[35008] to (701) 
[35009] meet (563) 
[35010] at (522) 
[35011] the (49) 
[35012] pool (41) 
[35013] midway (117) 
[35014] between (523) 
[35015] our (847) 
[35016] houses (655) 
[35017] to (546) 
[35018] talk (512) 
[35019] it (508) 
[35020] over (152) 
[35021] "When (819) 
[35022] I (189) 
[35023] went (99) 
[35024] down (592) 
[35025] there (718) 
[35026] I (131) 
[35027] found (703) 
[35028] him (59) 
[35029] talking (105) 
[35030] with (223) 
[35031] his (978) 
[35032] son, (384) 
[35033] so (821) 
[35034] I (578) 
[35035] smoked (300) 
[35036] a (372) 
[35037] cigar (810) 
[35038] and (13) 
[35039] waited (652) 
[35040] behind (990) 
[35041] a (748) 
[35042] tree (640) 
[35043] until (827) 
[35044] he (206) 
[35045] should (950) 
[35046] be (14) 
[35047] alone (627) 
[35048] But (432) 
[35049] as (108) 
[35050] I (431) 
[35051] listened (34) 
[35052] to (28) 
[35053] his (320) 
[35054] talk (424) 
[35055] all (663) 
[35056] that (102) 
[35057] was (228) 
[35058] black (296) 
[35059] and (384) 
[35060] bitter (411) 
[35061] in (56) 
[35062] me (114) 
[35063] seemed (178) 
[35064] to (146) 
[35065] come (609) 
[35066] uppermost (390) 
[35067] He (885) 
[35068] was (93) 
[35069] urging (39) 
[35070] his (666) 
[35071] son (196) 
[35072] to (692) 
[35073] marry (338) 
[35074] my (707) 
[35075] daughter (980) 
[35076] with (458) 
[35077] as (140) 
[35078] little (779) 
[35079] regard (802) 
[35080] for (291) 
[35081] what (303) 
[35082] she (395) 
[35083] might (331) 
[35084] think (498) 
[35085] as (868) 
[35086] if (450) 
[35087] she (209) 
[35088] were (112) 
[35089] a (352) 
[35090] slut (543) 
[35091] from (619) 
[35092] off (168) 
[35093] the (220) 
[35094] streets (856) 
[35095] It (215) 
[35096] drove (825) 
[35097] me (506) 
[35098] mad (114) 
[35099] to (218) 
[35100] think (28) 
[35101] that (509) 
[35102] I (698) 
[35103] and (307) 
[35104] all (780) 
[35105] that (258) 
[35106] I (556) 
[35107] held (341) 
[35108] most (556) 
[35109] dear (279) 
[35110] should (920) 
[35111] be (62) 
[35112] in (559) 
[35113] the (989) 
[35114] power (779) 
[35115] of (570) 
[35116] such (328) 
[35117] a (201) 
[35118] man (252) 
[35119] as (82) 
[35120] this (383) 
[35121] Could (635) 
[35122] I (52) 
[35123] not (223) 
[35124] snap (371) 
[35125] the (912) 
[35126] bond? (577) 
[35127] I (897) 
[35128] was (349) 
[35129] already (193) 
[35130] a (770) 
[35131] dying (397) 
[35132] and (325) 
[35133] a (357) 
[35134] desperate (852) 
[35135] man (11) 
[35136] Though (482) 
[35137] clear (368) 
[35138] of (423) 
[35139] mind (246) 
[35140] and (389) 
[35141] fairly (179) 
[35142] strong (823) 
[35143] of (5) 
[35144] limb, (915) 
[35145] I (976) 
[35146] knew (224) 
[35147] that (414) 
[35148] my (297) 
[35149] own (299) 
[35150] fate (802) 
[35151] was (363) 
[35152] sealed (596) 
[35153] But (543) 
[35154] my (963) 
[35155] memory (336) 
[35156] and (921) 
[35157] my (628) 
[35158] girl (42) 
[35159] Both (381) 
[35160] could (276) 
[35161] be (842) 
[35162] saved (513) 
[35163] if (447) 
[35164] I (264) 
[35165] could (636) 
[35166] but (199) 
[35167] silence (124) 
[35168] that (549) 
[35169] foul (812) 
[35170] tongue (4) 
[35171] I (377) 
[35172] did (512) 
[35173] it, (795) 
[35174] Mr (715) 
[35175] Holmes (897) 
[35176] I (613) 
[35177] would (663) 
[35178] do (997) 
[35179] it (30) 
[35180] again (199) 
[35181] Deeply (821) 
[35182] as (714) 
[35183] I (643) 
[35184] have (762) 
[35185] sinned, (828) 
[35186] I (559) 
[35187] have (40) 
[35188] led (866) 
[35189] a (806) 
[35190] life (770) 
[35191] of (798) 
[35192] martyrdom (453) 
[35193] to (105) 
[35194] atone (143) 
[35195] for (644) 
[35196] it (250) 
[35197] But (515) 
[35198] that (559) 
[35199] my (865) 
[35200] girl (131) 
[35201] should (834) 
[35202] be (484) 
[35203] entangled (515) 
[35204] in (738) 
[35205] the (210) 
[35206] same (218) 
[35207] meshes (287) 
[35208] which (707) 
[35209] held (159) 
[35210] me (744) 
[35211] was (278) 
[35212] more (626) 
[35213] than (118)

[35638] a (276)

[35700] one (493) 
[35701] of (418) 
[35702] these (66) 
[35703] last (596) 
[35704] which (19) 
[35705] was (462) 
[35706] so (487) 
[35707] remarkable (706) 
[35708] in (363) 
[35709] its (439) 
[35710] details (309) 
[35711] and (615) 
[35712] so (99) 
[35713] startling (641) 
[35714] in (266) 
[35715] its (754) 
[35716] results (771) 
[35717] that (913) 
[35718] I (928) 
[35719] am (546) 
[35720] tempted (216) 
[35721] to (168) 
[35722] give (641) 
[35723] some (640)

[35847] as (163) 
[35848] may (367) 
[35849] be (412) 
[35850] remembered, (167) 
[35851] Sherlock (54) 
[35852] Holmes (778) 
[35853] was (180) 
[35854] able, (843) 
[35855] by (864) 
[35856] winding (546) 
[35857] up (783) 
[35858] the (202) 
[35859] dead (231) 
[35860] man (16) 
[35861] s (284) 
[35862] watch, (268) 
[35863] to (511) 
[35864] prove (137) 
[35865] that (35) 
[35866] it (820) 
[35867] had (63) 
[35868] been (501) 
[35869] wound (223) 
[35870] up (828) 
[35871] two (902) 
[35872] hours (164) 
[35873] before, (248) 
[35874] and (259) 
[35875] that (483) 
[35876] therefore (386) 
[35877] the (197) 
[35878] deceased (746)

[35883] within (359) 
[35884] that (225) 
[35885] time (620) 
[35886] a (744) 
[35887] deduction (749) 
[35888] which (232) 
[35889] was (33) 
[35890] of (174) 
[35891] the (841) 
[35892] greatest (816) 
[35893] importance (270) 
[35894] in (398) 
[35895] clearing (361)

[35899] All (70) 
[35900] these (532) 
[35901] I (680) 
[35902] may (566)

[35906] some (752) 
[35907] future (250)

[35910] none (945)

[35914] such (533) 
[35915] singular (757) 
[35916] features (959) 
[35917] as (807) 
[35918] the (36)

[35921] of (201) 
[35922] circumstances (256) 
[35923] which (979) 
[35924] I (892) 
[35925] have (469) 
[35926] now (411) 
[35927] taken (624) 
[35928] up (550) 
[35929] my (746)

[35931] to (923)

[35933] It (881)

[35935] in (236) 
[35936] the (664)

[35938] days (653) 
[35939] of (654) 
[35940] September, (925) 
[35941] and (887) 
[35942] the (302) 
[35943] equinoctial (801) 
[35944] gales (31) 
[35945] had (672) 
[35946] set (792) 
[35947] in (971) 
[35948] with (856) 
[35949] exceptional (410) 
[35950] violence (382) 
[35951] All (795) 
[35952] day (800) 
[35953] the (931) 
[35954] wind (799) 
[35955] had (843) 
[35956] screamed (401) 
[35957] and (671) 
[35958] the (890) 
[35959] rain (575) 
[35960] had (498) 
[35961] beaten (673) 
[35962] against (11) 
[35963] the (240) 
[35964] windows, (768) 
[35965] so (407) 
[35966] that (417) 
[35967] even (986) 
[35968] here (652) 
[35969] in (957) 
[35970] the (927)

[35974] hand (786) 
[35975] made (646) 
[35976] London (295) 
[35977] we (495) 
[35978] were (74) 
[35979] forced (257) 
[35980] to (883) 
[35981] raise (744) 
[35982] our (640) 
[35983] minds (238) 
[35984] for (185) 
[35985] the (25) 
[35986] instant (765) 
[35987] from (123) 
[35988] the (809) 
[35989] routine (998) 
[35990] of (626) 
[35991] life (476) 
[35992] and (699) 
[35993] to (76) 
[35994] recognise (310) 
[35995] the (149) 
[35996] presence (498) 
[35997] of (955) 
[35998] those (682) 
[35999] great (584) 
[36000] elemental (898) 
[36001] forces (132) 
[36002] which (119) 
[36003] shriek (980) 
[36004] at (299) 
[36005] mankind (770) 
[36006] through (109) 
[36007] the (202) 
[36008] bars (905) 
[36009] of (669) 
[36010] his (324) 
[36011] civilisation, (412) 
[36012] like (157) 
[36013] untamed (705) 
[36014] beasts (829) 
[36015] in (223) 
[36016] a (40) 
[36017] cage (178) 
[36018] As (420) 
[36019] evening (321) 
[36020] drew (340) 
[36021] in, (872) 
[36022] the (372) 
[36023] storm (476) 
[36024] grew (573) 
[36025] higher (18) 
[36026] and (324) 
[36027] louder, (796) 
[36028] and (116) 
[36029] the (75) 
[36030] wind (402) 
[36031] cried (836) 
[36032] and (232) 
[36033] sobbed (168) 
[36034] like (342) 
[36035] a (485) 
[36036] child (369) 
[36037] in (962)

[36040] Sherlock (964) 
[36041] Holmes (407) 
[36042] sat (534) 
[36043] moodily (580) 
[36044] at (833) 
[36045] one (881) 
[36046] side (875) 
[36047] of (454) 
[36048] the (468) 
[36049] fireplace (424)

[36051] indexing (134) 
[36052] his (290)

[36072] until (467) 
[36073] the (531) 
[36074] howl (959) 
[36075] of (815) 
[36076] the (12) 
[36077] gale (15) 
[36078] from (567) 
[36079] without (646) 
[36080] seemed (123) 
[36081] to (450) 
[36082] blend (619) 
[36083] with (442) 
[36084] the (806) 
[36085] text, (50) 
[36086] and (341) 
[36087] the (354) 
[36088] splash (381) 
[36089] of (18) 
[36090] the (226) 
[36091] rain (527) 
[36092] to (322) 
[36093] lengthen (167) 
[36094] out (114) 
[36095] into (591) 
[36096] the (350)

[36103] My (737) 
[36104] wife (723) 
[36105] was (536) 
[36106] on (691) 
[36107] a (673)

[36114] for (599) 
[36115] a (187) 
[36116] few (604) 
[36117] days (998) 
[36118] I (40) 
[36119] was (650) 
[36120] a (177)

[36122] once (193) 
[36123] more (965) 
[36124] in (29) 
[36125] my (857)

[36130] Street (67) 
[36131] "Why," (148) 
[36132] said (199) 
[36133] I, (95) 
[36134] glancing (172) 
[36135] up (703) 
[36136] at (412) 
[36137] my (293) 
[36138] companion, (199) 
[36139] "that (659)

[36789] such (800) 
[36790] success (303) 
[36791] that (611) 
[36792] he (854) 
[36793] was (704) 
[36794] able (324) 
[36795] to (29)

[36871] three (132) 
[36872] or (991) 
[36873] four (616) 
[36874] years (379)

[36877] or (293) 
[36878] 1870 (242)

[36891] near (8)

[36898] considerable (855) 
[36899] fortune (672) 
[36900] in (464) 
[36901] the (412) 
[36902] States, (772) 
[36903] and (367) 
[36904] his (780) 
[36905] reason (125) 
[36906] for (824) 
[36907] leaving (455) 
[36908] them (438) 
[36909] was (684) 
[36910] his (88) 
[36911] aversion (737) 
[36912] to (271) 
[36913] the (553) 
[36914] negroes, (913) 
[36915] and (841) 
[36916] his (780) 
[36917] dislike (534) 
[36918] of (978) 
[36919] the (72) 
[36920] Republican (57)

[36929] was (6) 
[36930] a (520) 
[36931] singular (979) 
[36932] man, (3) 
[36933] fierce (825) 
[36934] and (286) 
[36935] quick (919) 
[36936] tempered, (675) 
[36937] very (529) 
[36938] foul (770) 
[36939] mouthed (163) 
[36940] when (540) 
[36941] he (18) 
[36942] was (818) 
[36943] angry, (677) 
[36944] and (470) 
[36945] of (552) 
[36946] a (734) 
[36947] most (585) 
[36948] retiring (414) 
[36949] disposition (745) 
[36950] During (494) 
[36951] all (988) 
[36952] the (865) 
[36953] years (803) 
[36954] that (249) 
[36955] he (266) 
[36956] lived (759) 
[36957] at (702) 
[36958] Horsham, (288) 
[36959] I (766) 
[36960] doubt (528) 
[36961] if (903) 
[36962] ever (835) 
[36963] he (495) 
[36964] set (383) 
[36965] foot (807) 
[36966] in (358) 
[36967] the (564) 
[36968] town (280) 
[36969] He (7) 
[36970] had (320) 
[36971] a (541) 
[36972] garden (96) 
[36973] and (313) 
[36974] two (853) 
[36975] or (542) 
[36976] three (481) 
[36977] fields (91) 
[36978] round (192) 
[36979] his (128) 
[36980] house, (423) 
[36981] and (245) 
[36982] there (807) 
[36983] he (742) 
[36984] would (934) 
[36985] take (439) 
[36986] his (633) 
[36987] exercise, (105) 
[36988] though (634) 
[36989] very (688) 
[36990] often (706) 
[36991] for (872) 
[36992] weeks (159) 
[36993] on (280) 
[36994] end (1) 
[36995] he (63) 
[36996] would (54) 
[36997] never (254) 
[36998] leave (135) 
[36999] his (202) 
[37000] room (588) 
[37001] He (280) 
[37002] drank (416) 
[37003] a (699) 
[37004] great (975) 
[37005] deal (195) 
[37006] of (803) 
[37007] brandy (889) 
[37008] and (374) 
[37009] smoked (285) 
[37010] very (943) 
[37011] heavily, (748) 
[37012] but (747) 
[37013] he (164) 
[37014] would (505) 
[37015] see (90) 
[37016] no (698) 
[37017] society (91) 
[37018] and (279) 
[37019] did (480) 
[37020] not (780) 
[37021] want (211) 
[37022] any (362) 
[37023] friends, (925) 
[37024] not (408) 
[37025] even (20) 
[37026] his (123) 
[37027] own (30) 
[37028] brother (147) 
[37029] "He (169) 
[37030] didn (896) 
[37031] t (233) 
[37032] mind (688) 
[37033] me; (231) 
[37034] in (876) 
[37035] fact, (10) 
[37036] he (36) 
[37037] took (270) 
[37038] a (125) 
[37039] fancy (435) 
[37040] to (996) 
[37041] me, (546) 
[37042] for (938) 
[37043] at (719) 
[37044] the (904) 
[37045] time (169) 
[37046] when (721) 
[37047] he (622) 
[37048] saw (767) 
[37049] me (641) 
[37050] first (954) 
[37051] I (738) 
[37052] was (772) 
[37053] a (986)

[37055] of (269) 
[37056] twelve (929) 
[37057] or (656) 
[37058] so (132) 
[37059] This (797) 
[37060] would (485) 
[37061] be (860) 
[37062] in (949) 
[37063] the (202) 
[37064] year (914) 
[37065] 1878, (172) 
[37066] after (777) 
[37067] he (345) 
[37068] had (488) 
[37069] been (919) 
[37070] eight (800) 
[37071] or (249) 
[37072] nine (421) 
[37073] years (280) 
[37074] in (446) 
[37075] England (377) 
[37076] He (194) 
[37077] begged (517) 
[37078] my (310) 
[37079] father (976) 
[37080] to (430) 
[37081] let (33)

[37084] with (369) 
[37085] him (636) 
[37086] and (437) 
[37087] he (72) 
[37088] was (600) 
[37089] very (886) 
[37090] kind (712) 
[37091] to (85) 
[37092] me (176) 
[37093] in (203) 
[37094] his (314) 
[37095] way (25) 
[37096] When (602) 
[37097] he (517) 
[37098] was (903) 
[37099] sober (355) 
[37100] he (643) 
[37101] used (503) 
[37102] to (699) 
[37103] be (906) 
[37104] fond (373) 
[37105] of (807) 
[37106] playing (39) 
[37107] backgammon (101) 
[37108] and (320) 
[37109] draughts (430) 
[37110] with (945) 
[37111] me, (584) 
[37112] and (737) 
[37113] he (493) 
[37114] would (392) 
[37115] make (598) 
[37116] me (464) 
[37117] his (531) 
[37118] representative (8)

[37124] with (158) 
[37125] the (595) 
[37126] tradespeople, (872) 
[37127] so (851) 
[37128] that (953) 
[37129] by (827) 
[37130] the (200) 
[37131] time (44) 
[37132] that (92) 
[37133] I (237) 
[37134] was (698) 
[37135] sixteen (936) 
[37136] I (828) 
[37137] was (425) 
[37138] quite (510) 
[37139] master (714) 
[37140] of (987) 
[37141] the (104) 
[37142] house (603)

[37144] kept (790) 
[37145] all (172) 
[37146] the (387) 
[37147] keys (327)

[37151] where (892) 
[37152] I (279) 
[37153] liked (158)

[37155] do (934) 
[37156] what (979) 
[37157] I (706) 
[37158] liked, (382) 
[37159] so (75) 
[37160] long (555) 
[37161] as (213) 
[37162] I (851) 
[37163] did (161) 
[37164] not (821) 
[37165] disturb (972) 
[37166] him (423)

[37170] There (967) 
[37171] was (614) 
[37172] one (526) 
[37173] singular (499) 
[37174] exception, (425) 
[37175] however, (572) 
[37176] for (291) 
[37177] he (582) 
[37178] had (986) 
[37179] a (646) 
[37180] single (541) 
[37181] room, (184)

[37194] which (821)

[37214] through (907) 
[37215] the (676)

[37217] but (943) 
[37218] I (405)

[37762] of (930) 
[37763] it (638) 
[37764] Yet (293) 
[37765] I (137) 
[37766] could (250) 
[37767] not (871) 
[37768] shake (661) 
[37769] off (14) 
[37770] the (928) 
[37771] vague (928) 
[37772] feeling (502) 
[37773] of (676) 
[37774] dread (233) 
[37775] which (477) 
[37776] it (143) 
[37777] left (749) 
[37778] behind, (187) 
[37779] though (118) 
[37780] the (624) 
[37781] sensation (19) 
[37782] grew (50) 
[37783] less (344) 
[37784] keen (611) 
[37785] as (684) 
[37786] the (349) 
[37787] weeks (209) 
[37788] passed (663) 
[37789] and (247) 
[37790] nothing (230) 
[37791] happened (825) 
[37792] to (579) 
[37793] disturb (378) 
[37794] the (479) 
[37795] usual (499) 
[37796] routine (154) 
[37797] of (596) 
[37798] our (400) 
[37799] lives (787) 
[37800] I (793) 
[37801] could (260) 
[37802] see (562) 
[37803] a (592) 
[37804] change (517) 
[37805] in (262) 
[37806] my (23) 
[37807] uncle, (988) 
[37808] however (175) 
[37809] He (356) 
[37810] drank (816) 
[37811] more (446) 
[37812] than (423) 
[37813] ever, (121) 
[37814] and (831) 
[37815] he (654) 
[37816] was (544) 
[37817] less (180) 
[37818] inclined (318) 
[37819] for (827) 
[37820] any (553) 
[37821] sort (7) 
[37822] of (583) 
[37823] society (861) 
[37824] Most (599) 
[37825] of (547) 
[37826] his (361) 
[37827] time (994) 
[37828] he (509) 
[37829] would (174) 
[37830] spend (33) 
[37831] in (896) 
[37832] his (325) 
[37833] room, (298) 
[37834] with (417) 
[37835] the (37) 
[37836] door (17) 
[37837] locked (213) 
[37838] upon (311) 
[37839] the (822) 
[37840] inside, (777) 
[37841] but (355) 
[37842] sometimes (61) 
[37843] he (553) 
[37844] would (798) 
[37845] emerge (441) 
[37846] in (17) 
[37847] a (67) 
[37848] sort (470) 
[37849] of (731) 
[37850] drunken (439) 
[37851] frenzy (979) 
[37852] and (187) 
[37853] would (687) 
[37854] burst (430) 
[37855] out (593) 
[37856] of (267) 
[37857] the (940) 
[37858] house (519) 
[37859] and (294) 
[37860] tear (409) 
[37861] about (121) 
[37862] the (511) 
[37863] garden (249) 
[37864] with (814) 
[37865] a (521) 
[37866] revolver (829) 
[37867] in (536) 
[37868] his (791) 
[37869] hand, (390) 
[37870] screaming (802) 
[37871] out (567) 
[37872] that (697) 
[37873] he (865) 
[37874] was (541) 
[37875] afraid (117) 
[37876] of (577) 
[37877] no (551) 
[37878] man, (839) 
[37879] and (143) 
[37880] that (407) 
[37881] he (896) 
[37882] was (143) 
[37883] not (763) 
[37884] to (116) 
[37885] be (605) 
[37886] cooped (295) 
[37887] up, (224) 
[37888] like (788) 
[37889] a (670) 
[37890] sheep (299) 
[37891] in (592) 
[37892] a (475) 
[37893] pen, (863) 
[37894] by (639) 
[37895] man (973) 
[37896] or (656) 
[37897] devil (535) 
[37898] When (333) 
[37899] these (95) 
[37900] hot (845) 
[37901] fits (812) 
[37902] were (746) 
[37903] over, (0) 
[37904] however, (607) 
[37905] he (631) 
[37906] would (469) 
[37907] rush (689) 
[37908] tumultuously (928) 
[37909] in (642) 
[37910] at (440) 
[37911] the (258) 
[37912] door (32) 
[37913] and (33) 
[37914] lock (995) 
[37915] and (914) 
[37916] bar (810) 
[37917] it (47) 
[37918] behind (662) 
[37919] him, (316) 
[37920] like (198) 
[37921] a (545) 
[37922] man (394) 
[37923] who (500) 
[37924] can (363) 
[37925] brazen (538) 
[37926] it (452) 
[37927] out (477) 
[37928] no (238) 
[37929] longer (789) 
[37930] against (546) 
[37931] the (322) 
[37932] terror (722) 
[37933] which (784) 
[37934] lies (818) 
[37935] at (242) 
[37936] the (132) 
[37937] roots (3) 
[37938] of (393) 
[37939] his (608) 
[37940] soul (622) 
[37941] At (53) 
[37942] such (891) 
[37943] times (33) 
[37944] I (43) 
[37945] have (167) 
[37946] seen (70) 
[37947] his (20) 
[37948] face, (599) 
[37949] even (275) 
[37950] on (785) 
[37951] a (717) 
[37952] cold (535) 
[37953] day, (147) 
[37954] glisten (981) 
[37955] with (162) 
[37956] moisture, (558) 
[37957] as (354) 
[37958] though (982) 
[37959] it (940) 
[37960] were (149) 
[37961] new (458) 
[37962] raised (626) 
[37963] from (988) 
[37964] a (796) 
[37965] basin (332) 
[37966] "Well, (854) 
[37967] to (871) 
[37968] come (654) 
[37969] to (981) 
[37970] an (576) 
[37971] end (19) 
[37972] of (233) 
[37973] the (685) 
[37974] matter, (702) 
[37975] Mr (623) 
[37976] Holmes, (191) 
[37977] and (179) 
[37978] not (635) 
[37979] to (994) 
[37980] abuse (20) 
[37981] your (716) 
[37982] patience, (253) 
[37983] there (723) 
[37984] came (86) 
[37985] a (118) 
[37986] night (138) 
[37987] when (746) 
[37988] he (811) 
[37989] made (92) 
[37990] one (829) 
[37991] of (872) 
[37992] those (504) 
[37993] drunken (804) 
[37994] sallies (129) 
[37995] from (564) 
[37996] which (138) 
[37997] he (461) 
[37998] never (449) 
[37999] came (35) 
[38000] back (602) 
[38001] We (578) 
[38002] found (685) 
[38003] him, (251) 
[38004] when (811) 
[38005] we (692) 
[38006] went (972) 
[38007] to (418) 
[38008] search (297) 
[38009] for (599) 
[38010] him, (72) 
[38011] face (513) 
[38012] downward (79) 
[38013] in (426) 
[38014] a (836) 
[38015] little (799) 
[38016] green (282) 
[38017] scummed (158) 
[38018] pool, (551) 
[38019] which (226) 
[38020] lay (141) 
[38021] at (863) 
[38022] the (467) 
[38023] foot (768) 
[38024] of (420) 
[38025] the (440) 
[38026] garden (810)

[38028] was (204) 
[38029] no (972) 
[38030] sign (258) 
[38031] of (250) 
[38032] any (137) 
[38033] violence, (927) 
[38034] and (695) 
[38035] the (672) 
[38036] water (48) 
[38037] was (518) 
[38038] but (718) 
[38039] two (780) 
[38040] feet (500) 
[38041] deep, (998) 
[38042] so (949) 
[38043] that (130) 
[38044] the (239) 
[38045] jury, (320) 
[38046] having (852) 
[38047] regard (105) 
[38048] to (163) 
[38049] his (454) 
[38050] known (337) 
[38051] eccentricity, (429) 
[38052] brought (955) 
[38053] in (178) 
[38054] a (466) 
[38055] verdict (444) 
[38056] of (386) 
[38057] suicide (583) 
[38058] But (867) 
[38059] I, (922) 
[38060] who (960) 
[38061] knew (409) 
[38062] how (876) 
[38063] he (742) 
[38064] winced (346) 
[38065] from (416) 
[38066] the (135) 
[38067] very (753) 
[38068] thought (468) 
[38069] of (793) 
[38070] death, (696) 
[38071] had (494) 
[38072] much (493) 
[38073] ado (656) 
[38074] to (321) 
[38075] persuade (757) 
[38076] myself (385) 
[38077] that (446) 
[38078] he (401) 
[38079] had (724) 
[38080] gone (851) 
[38081] out (717) 
[38082] of (810) 
[38083] his (12)

[38088] The (765) 
[38089] matter (185) 
[38090] passed, (452) 
[38091] however, (872) 
[38092] and (714) 
[38093] my (870) 
[38094] father (334)

[38103] some (695) 
[38104] $14,000, (864) 
[38105] which (118)

[38778] once (918) 
[38779] My (461) 
[38780] father (791) 
[38781] had (838) 
[38782] fallen (771) 
[38783] over (740) 
[38784] one (93) 
[38785] of (12) 
[38786] the (826) 
[38787] deep (40) 
[38788] chalk (986) 
[38789] pits (197) 
[38790] which (697) 
[38791] abound (742) 
[38792] in (109) 
[38793] the (759) 
[38794] neighbourhood, (724) 
[38795] and (895) 
[38796] was (434) 
[38797] lying (696) 
[38798] senseless, (954) 
[38799] with (438) 
[38800] a (397) 
[38801] shattered (947) 
[38802] skull (112)

[38804] hurried (574) 
[38805] to (222) 
[38806] him, (459) 
[38807] but (901) 
[38808] he (764) 
[38809] passed (617) 
[38810] away (354) 
[38811] without (731) 
[38812] having (176) 
[38813] ever (473) 
[38814] recovered (442) 
[38815] his (686) 
[38816] consciousness (812) 
[38817] He (526) 
[38818] had, (60) 
[38819] as (491) 
[38820] it (475) 
[38821] appears, (291) 
[38822] been (331) 
[38823] returning (886) 
[38824] from (763) 
[38825] Fareham (923) 
[38826] in (133) 
[38827] the (490) 
[38828] twilight, (645) 
[38829] and (881) 
[38830] as (37) 
[38831] the (9) 
[38832] country (77) 
[38833] was (622) 
[38834] unknown (505) 
[38835] to (533) 
[38836] him, (718) 
[38837] and (248) 
[38838] the (870) 
[38839] chalk (494) 
[38840] pit (597) 
[38841] unfenced, (13) 
[38842] the (168) 
[38843] jury (928) 
[38844] had (93) 
[38845] no (329) 
[38846] hesitation (89) 
[38847] in (815) 
[38848] bringing (385) 
[38849] in (558) 
[38850] a (684) 
[38851] verdict (818) 
[38852] of (202) 
[38853] death (269) 
[38854] from (326) 
[38855] accidental (88) 
[38856] causes (379) 
[38857] Carefully (493) 
[38858] as (295) 
[38859] I (21) 
[38860] examined (230) 
[38861] every (528) 
[38862] fact (529) 
[38863] connected (609) 
[38864] with (848) 
[38865] his (58) 
[38866] death, (596) 
[38867] I (488) 
[38868] was (133) 
[38869] unable (174) 
[38870] to (764) 
[38871] find (982) 
[38872] anything (304) 
[38873] which (504) 
[38874] could (723) 
[38875] suggest (483) 
[38876] the (890) 
[38877] idea (632) 
[38878] of (811) 
[38879] murder (995) 
[38880] There (443) 
[38881] were (484) 
[38882] no (549) 
[38883] signs (170) 
[38884] of (373) 
[38885] violence, (904) 
[38886] no (152) 
[38887] footmarks, (72) 
[38888] no (979) 
[38889] robbery, (649) 
[38890] no (139) 
[38891] record (793) 
[38892] of (169) 
[38893] strangers (495) 
[38894] having (238) 
[38895] been (351) 
[38896] seen (755) 
[38897] upon (262) 
[38898] the (566) 
[38899] roads (99) 
[38900] And (13) 
[38901] yet (692) 
[38902] I (954) 
[38903] need (195) 
[38904] not (96) 
[38905] tell (395) 
[38906] you (260) 
[38907] that (575) 
[38908] my (58) 
[38909] mind (28)

[38911] far (346) 
[38912] from (871) 
[38913] at (890) 
[38914] ease, (971) 
[38915] and (90) 
[38916] that (863) 
[38917] I (995) 
[38918] was (320) 
[38919] well (411) 
[38920] nigh (581) 
[38921] certain (291) 
[38922] that (573) 
[38923] some (660) 
[38924] foul (455) 
[38925] plot (949) 
[38926] had (774) 
[38927] been (576) 
[38928] woven (775) 
[38929] round (816) 
[38930] him (90)

[38954] I (424) 
[38955] was (682)

[39454] "that (693)

[39459] my (501)

[39462] the (831)

[40344] in (840) 
[40345] the (313) 
[40346] study (602) 
[40347] which (634) 
[40348] have (707) 
[40349] baffled (613) 
[40350] all (801) 
[40351] those (492) 
[40352] who (735)

[40368] to (405) 
[40369] its (978) 
[40370] highest (878) 
[40371] pitch, (933) 
[40372] it (897) 
[40373] is (92) 
[40374] necessary (696) 
[40375] that (716) 
[40376] the (749) 
[40377] reasoner (875) 
[40378] should (859)

[40396] implies, (52) 
[40397] as (946) 
[40398] you (275) 
[40399] will (681) 
[40400] readily (322) 
[40401] see, (950) 
[40402] a (917) 
[40403] possession (838) 
[40404] of (760) 
[40405] all (396) 
[40406] knowledge, (561) 
[40407] which, (5) 
[40408] even (938) 
[40409] in (81) 
[40410] these (352) 
[40411] days (718)

[40414] education (536) 
[40415] and (385) 
[40416] encyclopaedias, (299) 
[40417] is (113) 
[40418] a (667) 
[40419] somewhat (660) 
[40420] rare (37) 
[40421] accomplishment (984)

[40423] is (236) 
[40424] not (966) 
[40425] so (300) 
[40426] impossible, (257) 
[40427] however, (626) 
[40428] that (771) 
[40429] a (27) 
[40430] man (223) 
[40431] should (238) 
[40432] possess (67) 
[40433] all (636) 
[40434] knowledge (873) 
[40435] which (935) 
[40436] is (648) 
[40437] likely (225) 
[40438] to (96) 
[40439] be (468) 
[40440] useful (463) 
[40441] to (161) 
[40442] him (898) 
[40443] in (410) 
[40444] his (717) 
[40445] work, (434) 
[40446] and (303)

[40738] may (860) 
[40739] assume (121) 
[40740] as (570) 
[40741] a (778)

[40743] hypothesis (750)

[40750] or (750) 
[40751] something (541)

[40755] from (944)

[40766] only (115) 
[40767] deduce (29)

[41842] "You (799) 
[41843] will (831) 
[41844] not (247) 
[41845] go (631)

[41848] "No, (923)

[41921] He (783)

[41967] near (376)

[41981] The (371) 
[41982] night, (950) 
[41983] however, (775) 
[41984] was (909) 
[41985] extremely (352) 
[41986] dark (171)

[41997] several (91) 
[41998] passers (473) 
[41999] by, (139)

[42010] however, (708) 
[42011] was (888) 
[42012] given, (574)

[42028] to (686)

[42042] envelope (542) 
[42043] which (748) 
[42044] was (865) 
[42045] found (121) 
[42046] in (339) 
[42047] his (30) 
[42048] pocket, (662)

[42050] John (900) 
[42051] Openshaw, (406) 
[42052] and (981) 
[42053] whose (398) 
[42054] residence (994) 
[42055] is (475) 
[42056] near (951) 
[42057] Horsham (445) 
[42058] It (915) 
[42059] is (485) 
[42060] conjectured (233) 
[42061] that (759) 
[42062] he (5) 
[42063] may (311) 
[42064] have (522) 
[42065] been (801)

[42076] and (627) 
[42077] that (772) 
[42078] in (337) 
[42079] his (159) 
[42080] haste (794) 
[42081] and (714) 
[42082] the (913) 
[42083] extreme (321) 
[42084] darkness (965) 
[42085] he (981) 
[42086] missed (557) 
[42087] his (108) 
[42088] path (197) 
[42089] and (766) 
[42090] walked (179) 
[42091] over (192) 
[42092] the (919) 
[42093] edge (336) 
[42094] of (682) 
[42095] one (271) 
[42096] of (422)

[42101] for (494) 
[42102] river (918) 
[42103] steamboats (862) 
[42104] The (290) 
[42105] body (199) 
[42106] exhibited (562) 
[42107] no (156) 
[42108] traces (932) 
[42109] of (585) 
[42110] violence, (853) 
[42111] and (100) 
[42112] there (599) 
[42113] can (459) 
[42114] be (574) 
[42115] no (271) 
[42116] doubt (669) 
[42117] that (313) 
[42118] the (769) 
[42119] deceased (366) 
[42120] had (95) 
[42121] been (847) 
[42122] the (853) 
[42123] victim (737) 
[42124] of (877) 
[42125] an (116) 
[42126] unfortunate (932) 
[42127] accident, (786) 
[42128] which (808) 
[42129] should (761) 
[42130] have (884) 
[42131] the (833) 
[42132] effect (801) 
[42133] of (507) 
[42134] calling (342) 
[42135] the (476) 
[42136] attention (446) 
[42137] of (420) 
[42138] the (734) 
[42139] authorities (296) 
[42140] to (312) 
[42141] the (28) 
[42142] condition (176) 
[42143] of (558) 
[42144] the (675)

[42146] landing (786) 
[42147] stages (58) 
[42148] " (53) 
[42149] We (243) 
[42150] sat (383) 
[42151] in (20) 
[42152] silence (584) 
[42153] for (0) 
[42154] some (81) 
[42155] minutes, (61) 
[42156] Holmes (200) 
[42157] more (946) 
[42158] depressed (926) 
[42159] and (274) 
[42160] shaken (276) 
[42161] than (576) 
[42162] I (505) 
[42163] had (812) 
[42164] ever (487)

[42172] he (344) 
[42173] said (777) 
[42174] at (265) 
[42175] last (776) 
[42176] "It (119) 
[42177] is (657)

[42181] no (644)

[43251] about (962) 
[43252] the (696)

[43254] when (262) 
[43255] a (819)

[43284] made (2) 
[43285] a (31) 
[43286] little (773) 
[43287] face (970) 
[43288] of (356) 
[43289] disappointment (811) 
[43290] "A (2)

[43354] my (346) 
[43355] calling (950) 
[43356] so (487) 
[43357] late," (199) 
[43358] she (43) 
[43359] began, (556) 
[43360] and (594) 
[43361] then, (9) 
[43362] suddenly (786) 
[43363] losing (846) 
[43364] her (770) 
[43365] self (695) 
[43366] control, (133) 
[43367] she (624) 
[43368] ran (144) 
[43369] forward, (971) 
[43370] threw (34) 
[43371] her (27) 
[43372] arms (598) 
[43373] about (943) 
[43374] my (332) 
[43375] wife (914) 
[43376] s (728) 
[43377] neck, (322) 
[43378] and (478) 
[43379] sobbed (980) 
[43380] upon (207) 
[43381] her (622) 
[43382] shoulder (841) 
[43383] "Oh, (827)

[43400] "Why," (612) 
[43401] said (467) 
[43402] my (548) 
[43403] wife, (213) 
[43404] pulling (314)

[43564] We (149) 
[43565] soothed (628) 
[43566] and (394) 
[43567] comforted (888) 
[43568] her (787) 
[43569] by (425) 
[43570] such (148) 
[43571] words (808) 
[43572] as (243) 
[43573] we (160) 
[43574] could (929)

[43579] where (96) 
[43580] her (871)

[43606] late (358) 
[43607] he (298) 
[43608] had, (517) 
[43609] when (298) 
[43610] the (665) 
[43611] fit (176) 
[43612] was (290) 
[43613] on (398) 
[43614] him, (858) 
[43615] made (904) 
[43616] use (493) 
[43617] of (819) 
[43618] an (575)

[43629] his (770)

[43632] always (390) 
[43633] been (510) 
[43634] confined (243) 
[43635] to (484) 
[43636] one (667) 
[43637] day, (883) 
[43638] and (145) 
[43639] he (208) 
[43640] had (106) 
[43641] come (383) 
[43642] back, (517) 
[43643] twitching (435) 
[43644] and (587) 
[43645] shattered, (109) 
[43646] in (83) 
[43647] the (63) 
[43648] evening (352) 
[43649] But (826) 
[43650] now (490) 
[43651] the (560) 
[43652] spell (876) 
[43653] had (263) 
[43654] been (363) 
[43655] upon (320) 
[43656] him (203) 
[43657] eight (549) 
[43658] and (100) 
[43659] forty (726) 
[43660] hours, (591) 
[43661] and (836) 
[43662] he (725) 
[43663] lay (268) 
[43664] there, (524) 
[43665] doubtless (669) 
[43666] among (529) 
[43667] the (126) 
[43668] dregs (332) 
[43669] of (520) 
[43670] the (170) 
[43671] docks, (826) 
[43672] breathing (251) 
[43673] in (489) 
[43674] the (490) 
[43675] poison (706) 
[43676] or (535) 
[43677] sleeping (742) 
[43678] off (768) 
[43679] the (960) 
[43680] effects (459) 
[43681] There (365) 
[43682] he (588) 
[43683] was (534) 
[43684] to (170) 
[43685] be (705) 
[43686] found, (634) 
[43687] she (403) 
[43688] was (831) 
[43689] sure (50) 
[43690] of (569) 
[43691] it, (902) 
[43692] at (612) 
[43693] the (399) 
[43694] Bar (601) 
[43695] of (822) 
[43696] Gold, (54) 
[43697] in (512) 
[43698] Upper (955) 
[43699] Swandam (536) 
[43700] Lane (296) 
[43701] But (32) 
[43702] what (580) 
[43703] was (262) 
[43704] she (795) 
[43705] to (556) 
[43706] do? (526) 
[43707] How (742) 
[43708] could (494) 
[43709] she, (996) 
[43710] a (976) 
[43711] young (502) 
[43712] and (842) 
[43713] timid (743) 
[43714] woman, (716) 
[43715] make (651) 
[43716] her (194) 
[43717] way (452) 
[43718] into (704) 
[43719] such (808) 
[43720] a (968) 
[43721] place (911) 
[43722] and (575) 
[43723] pluck (474) 
[43724] her (558) 
[43725] husband (868) 
[43726] out (610) 
[43727] from (330) 
[43728] among (644) 
[43729] the (463) 
[43730] ruffians (645) 
[43731] who (828) 
[43732] surrounded (161) 
[43733] him? (332) 
[43734] There (127) 
[43735] was (947) 
[43736] the (485) 
[43737] case, (259) 
[43738] and (185) 
[43739] of (26) 
[43740] course (268) 
[43741] there (547) 
[43742] was (480) 
[43743] but (956) 
[43744] one (443) 
[43745] way (302) 
[43746] out (371) 
[43747] of (590) 
[43748] it (117) 
[43749] Might (277) 
[43750] I (529) 
[43751] not (753) 
[43752] escort (346) 
[43753] her (668) 
[43754] to (904) 
[43755] this (529) 
[43756] place? (672) 
[43757] And (107) 
[43758] then, (8) 
[43759] as (935) 
[43760] a (818) 
[43761] second (930) 
[43762] thought, (599) 
[43763] why (817) 
[43764] should (940) 
[43765] she (539) 
[43766] come (939) 
[43767] at (137) 
[43768] all? (53) 
[43769] I (143) 
[43770] was (580) 
[43771] Isa (880) 
[43772] Whitney (441) 
[43773] s (66) 
[43774] medical (630) 
[43775] adviser, (217) 
[43776] and (105) 
[43777] as (421) 
[43778] such (721) 
[43779] I (792) 
[43780] had (450) 
[43781] influence (728) 
[43782] over (173) 
[43783] him (772) 
[43784] I (533) 
[43785] could (55) 
[43786] manage (963) 
[43787] it (531) 
[43788] better (558) 
[43789] if (107) 
[43790] I (415) 
[43791] were (599) 
[43792] alone (971) 
[43793] I (547) 
[43794] promised (120) 
[43795] her (277) 
[43796] on (923) 
[43797] my (398) 
[43798] word (355) 
[43799] that (819) 
[43800] I (334) 
[43801] would (662) 
[43802] send (436) 
[43803] him (472) 
[43804] home (353) 
[43805] in (565) 
[43806] a (3) 
[43807] cab (792) 
[43808] within (397) 
[43809] two (576) 
[43810] hours (190) 
[43811] if (708) 
[43812] he (954) 
[43813] were (974) 
[43814] indeed (782) 
[43815] at (870) 
[43816] the (311) 
[43817] address (995) 
[43818] which (425) 
[43819] she (138) 
[43820] had (792) 
[43821] given (545) 
[43822] me (815) 
[43823] And (943) 
[43824] so (773) 
[43825] in (740) 
[43826] ten (794) 
[43827] minutes (936) 
[43828] I (576) 
[43829] had (895) 
[43830] left (843) 
[43831] my (938) 
[43832] armchair (598) 
[43833] and (463) 
[43834] cheery (113) 
[43835] sitting (774) 
[43836] room (800) 
[43837] behind (719) 
[43838] me, (694) 
[43839] and (82) 
[43840] was (948) 
[43841] speeding (937) 
[43842] eastward (158) 
[43843] in (139) 
[43844] a (840) 
[43845] hansom (911) 
[43846] on (203) 
[43847] a (697) 
[43848] strange (112) 
[43849] errand, (583) 
[43850] as (504) 
[43851] it (569) 
[43852] seemed (224) 
[43853] to (386) 
[43854] me (775) 
[43855] at (63) 
[43856] the (552) 
[43857] time, (373) 
[43858] though (764) 
[43859] the (13)

[43865] strange (720) 
[43866] it (934)

[43885] Lane (328) 
[43886] is (530) 
[43887] a (867) 
[43888] vile (727) 
[43889] alley (487) 
[43890] lurking (744) 
[43891] behind (590) 
[43892] the (832) 
[43893] high (139) 
[43894] wharves (121) 
[43895] which (917) 
[43896] line (364) 
[43897] the (641) 
[43898] north (209) 
[43899] side (662) 
[43900] of (228) 
[43901] the (505)

[43910] a (750) 
[43911] slop (619) 
[43912] shop (687) 
[43913] and (453) 
[43914] a (292) 
[43915] gin (267) 
[43916] shop, (346) 
[43917] approached (491) 
[43918] by (887) 
[43919] a (121) 
[43920] steep (480) 
[43921] flight (716) 
[43922] of (49) 
[43923] steps (631) 
[43924] leading (458) 
[43925] down (855) 
[43926] to (902) 
[43927] a (981) 
[43928] black (536) 
[43929] gap (536) 
[43930] like (887) 
[43931] the (648) 
[43932] mouth (519) 
[43933] of (417) 
[43934] a (101) 
[43935] cave, (868) 
[43936] I (116) 
[43937] found (903) 
[43938] the (755) 
[43939] den (407) 
[43940] of (992) 
[43941] which (838) 
[43942] I (469) 
[43943] was (622) 
[43944] in (171) 
[43945] search (725) 
[43946] Ordering (988) 
[43947] my (743) 
[43948] cab (511) 
[43949] to (761) 
[43950] wait, (297) 
[43951] I (895) 
[43952] passed (646) 
[43953] down (243) 
[43954] the (294) 
[43955] steps, (799) 
[43956] worn (617) 
[43957] hollow (416) 
[43958] in (814) 
[43959] the (571) 
[43960] centre (21) 
[43961] by (484) 
[43962] the (851) 
[43963] ceaseless (694) 
[43964] tread (800) 
[43965] of (542) 
[43966] drunken (197) 
[43967] feet; (705) 
[43968] and (129) 
[43969] by (822) 
[43970] the (413) 
[43971] light (56) 
[43972] of (863) 
[43973] a (738) 
[43974] flickering (68) 
[43975] oil (906) 
[43976] lamp (955) 
[43977] above (110) 
[43978] the (628) 
[43979] door (582) 
[43980] I (556) 
[43981] found (171) 
[43982] the (3) 
[43983] latch (687) 
[43984] and (652) 
[43985] made (736) 
[43986] my (872) 
[43987] way (968) 
[43988] into (400) 
[43989] a (352) 
[43990] long, (279) 
[43991] low (932) 
[43992] room, (252) 
[43993] thick (303) 
[43994] and (503) 
[43995] heavy (93) 
[43996] with (712) 
[43997] the (634) 
[43998] brown (354) 
[43999] opium (518) 
[44000] smoke, (463) 
[44001] and (752) 
[44002] terraced (31) 
[44003] with (875) 
[44004] wooden (781) 
[44005] berths, (999) 
[44006] like (418) 
[44007] the (496) 
[44008] forecastle (942) 
[44009] of (222) 
[44010] an (914) 
[44011] emigrant (814) 
[44012] ship (402) 
[44013] Through (44) 
[44014] the (873) 
[44015] gloom (314) 
[44016] one (228) 
[44017] could (960) 
[44018] dimly (825) 
[44019] catch (957) 
[44020] a (948) 
[44021] glimpse (145) 
[44022] of (268) 
[44023] bodies (175) 
[44024] lying (816) 
[44025] in (203) 
[44026] strange (107) 
[44027] fantastic (407) 
[44028] poses, (603) 
[44029] bowed (646) 
[44030] shoulders, (545) 
[44031] bent (974) 
[44032] knees, (912) 
[44033] heads (499) 
[44034] thrown (551) 
[44035] back, (974) 
[44036] and (259) 
[44037] chins (733) 
[44038] pointing (697) 
[44039] upward, (479) 
[44040] with (865) 
[44041] here (740) 
[44042] and (850) 
[44043] there (260) 
[44044] a (75) 
[44045] dark, (38) 
[44046] lack (822) 
[44047] lustre (735) 
[44048] eye (122) 
[44049] turned (552) 
[44050] upon (19) 
[44051] the (823) 
[44052] newcomer (105) 
[44053] Out (699) 
[44054] of (909) 
[44055] the (281) 
[44056] black (517) 
[44057] shadows (390) 
[44058] there (560) 
[44059] glimmered (51) 
[44060] little (670) 
[44061] red (986) 
[44062] circles (300) 
[44063] of (664) 
[44064] light, (900) 
[44065] now (642) 
[44066] bright, (558) 
[44067] now (96) 
[44068] faint, (397) 
[44069] as (346) 
[44070] the (919) 
[44071] burning (284) 
[44072] poison (455) 
[44073] waxed (497) 
[44074] or (519) 
[44075] waned (156) 
[44076] in (72) 
[44077] the (516) 
[44078] bowls (316) 
[44079] of (662) 
[44080] the (256) 
[44081] metal (683) 
[44082] pipes (836) 
[44083] The (77) 
[44084] most (318) 
[44085] lay (48) 
[44086] silent, (521) 
[44087] but (151) 
[44088] some (189) 
[44089] muttered (633) 
[44090] to (523) 
[44091] themselves, (547) 
[44092] and (305) 
[44093] others (490) 
[44094] talked (859) 
[44095] together (166) 
[44096] in (997) 
[44097] a (115) 
[44098] strange, (333) 
[44099] low, (257) 
[44100] monotonous (885) 
[44101] voice, (603) 
[44102] their (429) 
[44103] conversation (762) 
[44104] coming (200) 
[44105] in (262) 
[44106] gushes, (752) 
[44107] and (269) 
[44108] then (113) 
[44109] suddenly (42) 
[44110] tailing (414) 
[44111] off (77) 
[44112] into (774) 
[44113] silence, (532) 
[44114] each (873) 
[44115] mumbling (170) 
[44116] out (765) 
[44117] his (891) 
[44118] own (788) 
[44119] thoughts (745) 
[44120] and (826) 
[44121] paying (94) 
[44122] little (963) 
[44123] heed (497) 
[44124] to (227) 
[44125] the (395) 
[44126] words (289) 
[44127] of (552) 
[44128] his (699) 
[44129] neighbour (243) 
[44130] At (162) 
[44131] the (484) 
[44132] farther (82) 
[44133] end (698) 
[44134] was (54) 
[44135] a (515) 
[44136] small (51) 
[44137] brazier (198) 
[44138] of (228) 
[44139] burning (595) 
[44140] charcoal, (16) 
[44141] beside (69) 
[44142] which (158) 
[44143] on (618) 
[44144] a (625) 
[44145] three (177) 
[44146] legged (586) 
[44147] wooden (505) 
[44148] stool (151) 
[44149] there (351) 
[44150] sat (645) 
[44151] a (442) 
[44152] tall, (589) 
[44153] thin (565) 
[44154] old (678) 
[44155] man, (951) 
[44156] with (705) 
[44157] his (532) 
[44158] jaw (47) 
[44159] resting (195) 
[44160] upon (166) 
[44161] his (459) 
[44162] two (794) 
[44163] fists, (296) 
[44164] and (918) 
[44165] his (761) 
[44166] elbows (776) 
[44167] upon (664) 
[44168] his (585) 
[44169] knees, (401) 
[44170] staring (858) 
[44171] into (612) 
[44172] the (514) 
[44173] fire (777) 
[44174] As (547) 
[44175] I (480) 
[44176] entered, (631) 
[44177] a (680) 
[44178] sallow (140) 
[44179] Malay (879) 
[44180] attendant (799) 
[44181] had (159) 
[44182] hurried (58) 
[44183] up (909) 
[44184] with (682) 
[44185] a (409) 
[44186] pipe (550) 
[44187] for (804) 
[44188] me (138) 
[44189] and (672) 
[44190] a (435) 
[44191] supply (833) 
[44192] of (762) 
[44193] the (937) 
[44194] drug, (309) 
[44195] beckoning (848) 
[44196] me (885) 
[44197] to (992) 
[44198] an (580) 
[44199] empty (381)

[44370] a (831) 
[44371] few (8) 
[44372] hours, (171) 
[44373] three (27) 
[44374] pipes, (489) 
[44375] four (259) 
[44376] pipes (450) 
[44377] I (748) 
[44378] forget (246) 
[44379] how (94) 
[44380] many (466) 
[44381] But (460) 
[44382] I (360) 
[44383] ll (824) 
[44384] go (28) 
[44385] home (510) 
[44386] with (31) 
[44387] you (420) 
[44388] I (837) 
[44389] wouldn (616)

[44392] Kate (361)

[44394] little (930) 
[44395] Kate (225) 
[44396] Give (114) 
[44397] me (185) 
[44398] your (291) 
[44399] hand (772) 
[44400] Have (917) 
[44401] you (624) 
[44402] a (489) 
[44403] cab?" (712) 
[44404] "Yes, (839) 
[44405] I (909) 
[44406] have (802) 
[44407] one (4) 
[44408] waiting (394)

[44410] "Then (534) 
[44411] I (890) 
[44412] shall (357) 
[44413] go (678)

[44434] nothing (961) 
[44435] for (697) 
[44436] myself (389) 
[44437] " (850) 
[44438] I (853) 
[44439] walked (991) 
[44440] down (800) 
[44441] the (514) 
[44442] narrow (733) 
[44443] passage (620) 
[44444] between (536) 
[44445] the (612) 
[44446] double (849) 
[44447] row (225) 
[44448] of (827) 
[44449] sleepers, (461) 
[44450] holding (207) 
[44451] my (399) 
[44452] breath (574) 
[44453] to (715) 
[44454] keep (556) 
[44455] out (554) 
[44456] the (384) 
[44457] vile, (42) 
[44458] stupefying (499) 
[44459] fumes (722) 
[44460] of (618) 
[44461] the (958) 
[44462] drug, (570) 
[44463] and (611) 
[44464] looking (775) 
[44465] about (64) 
[44466] for (780) 
[44467] the (962) 
[44468] manager (84) 
[44469] As (964) 
[44470] I (751) 
[44471] passed (536) 
[44472] the (122) 
[44473] tall (254) 
[44474] man (765) 
[44475] who (304) 
[44476] sat (929) 
[44477] by (947) 
[44478] the (823) 
[44479] brazier (399) 
[44480] I (384) 
[44481] felt (263) 
[44482] a (633) 
[44483] sudden (480) 
[44484] pluck (762) 
[44485] at (600) 
[44486] my (13) 
[44487] skirt, (820) 
[44488] and (200) 
[44489] a (532) 
[44490] low (398) 
[44491] voice (588) 
[44492] whispered, (671) 
[44493] "Walk (971) 
[44494] past (789) 
[44495] me, (168) 
[44496] and (918) 
[44497] then (661) 
[44498] look (596) 
[44499] back (59) 
[44500] at (821) 
[44501] me (794) 
[44502] " (950) 
[44503] The (544) 
[44504] words (6) 
[44505] fell (565) 
[44506] quite (322) 
[44507] distinctly (839) 
[44508] upon (325) 
[44509] my (414) 
[44510] ear (308) 
[44511] I (906) 
[44512] glanced (920) 
[44513] down (969) 
[44514] They (88) 
[44515] could (140) 
[44516] only (275) 
[44517] have (876) 
[44518] come (519) 
[44519] from (624) 
[44520] the (313) 
[44521] old (362) 
[44522] man (636) 
[44523] at (701) 
[44524] my (447) 
[44525] side, (463) 
[44526] and (259) 
[44527] yet (759) 
[44528] he (985) 
[44529] sat (505) 
[44530] now (518) 
[44531] as (20) 
[44532] absorbed (504) 
[44533] as (168) 
[44534] ever, (633) 
[44535] very (581) 
[44536] thin, (5) 
[44537] very (390) 
[44538] wrinkled, (85) 
[44539] bent (378) 
[44540] with (591) 
[44541] age, (6) 
[44542] an (582) 
[44543] opium (408) 
[44544] pipe (393) 
[44545] dangling (659) 
[44546] down (163) 
[44547] from (112) 
[44548] between (50) 
[44549] his (914) 
[44550] knees, (327) 
[44551] as (696) 
[44552] though (774) 
[44553] it (349) 
[44554] had (100) 
[44555] dropped (767) 
[44556] in (595) 
[44557] sheer (285) 
[44558] lassitude (470) 
[44559] from (395) 
[44560] his (539) 
[44561] fingers (122) 
[44562] I (171) 
[44563] took (318) 
[44564] two (307) 
[44565] steps (839) 
[44566] forward (933) 
[44567] and (836) 
[44568] looked (789) 
[44569] back (895) 
[44570] It (439) 
[44571] took (546) 
[44572] all (914) 
[44573] my (567) 
[44574] self (541) 
[44575] control (976) 
[44576] to (835) 
[44577] prevent (436) 
[44578] me (845) 
[44579] from (2) 
[44580] breaking (54) 
[44581] out (128) 
[44582] into (246) 
[44583] a (961) 
[44584] cry (377) 
[44585] of (171) 
[44586] astonishment (236) 
[44587] He (756) 
[44588] had (997) 
[44589] turned (304) 
[44590] his (196) 
[44591] back (62) 
[44592] so (890) 
[44593] that (620) 
[44594] none (67) 
[44595] could (531) 
[44596] see (574) 
[44597] him (683) 
[44598] but (945) 
[44599] I (115) 
[44600] His (683) 
[44601] form (880) 
[44602] had (612) 
[44603] filled (995) 
[44604] out, (30) 
[44605] his (176) 
[44606] wrinkles (959) 
[44607] were (139) 
[44608] gone, (789) 
[44609] the (579) 
[44610] dull (731) 
[44611] eyes (499) 
[44612] had (262) 
[44613] regained (403) 
[44614] their (640) 
[44615] fire, (128) 
[44616] and (91) 
[44617] there, (37) 
[44618] sitting (702) 
[44619] by (678) 
[44620] the (572) 
[44621] fire (494) 
[44622] and (160) 
[44623] grinning (910) 
[44624] at (931) 
[44625] my (584) 
[44626] surprise, (113) 
[44627] was (213) 
[44628] none (934) 
[44629] other (45) 
[44630] than (141) 
[44631] Sherlock (208) 
[44632] Holmes (133) 
[44633] He (671) 
[44634] made (684) 
[44635] a (107) 
[44636] slight (555) 
[44637] motion (330) 
[44638] to (501) 
[44639] me (82) 
[44640] to (307) 
[44641] approach (862) 
[44642] him, (967) 
[44643] and (95) 
[44644] instantly, (282) 
[44645] as (681) 
[44646] he (456) 
[44647] turned (985) 
[44648] his (983) 
[44649] face (331) 
[44650] half (328) 
[44651] round (719) 
[44652] to (305) 
[44653] the (844) 
[44654] company (508) 
[44655] once (441) 
[44656] more, (848) 
[44657] subsided (996) 
[44658] into (357) 
[44659] a (473) 
[44660] doddering, (878) 
[44661] loose (598) 
[44662] lipped (346) 
[44663] senility (673) 
[44664] "Holmes (906) 
[44665] " (448) 
[44666] I (152) 
[44667] whispered, (389) 
[44668] "what (209) 
[44669] on (301) 
[44670] earth (675) 
[44671] are (270)

[44680] you (834) 
[44681] can," (701) 
[44682] he (219) 
[44683] answered; (451) 
[44684] "I (19) 
[44685] have (370)

[44787] It (516)

[44789] difficult (789)

[44802] exceedingly (363) 
[44803] definite, (311)

[44812] of (173) 
[44813] mastery (789) 
[44814] I (798) 
[44815] felt, (244) 
[44816] however, (663) 
[44817] that (204) 
[44818] when (137) 
[44819] Whitney (823) 
[44820] was (211) 
[44821] once (859) 
[44822] confined (490) 
[44823] in (484) 
[44824] the (780) 
[44825] cab (719)

[44828] was (466) 
[44829] practically (866)

[44851] those (898) 
[44852] singular (141) 
[44853] adventures (94) 
[44854] which (897) 
[44855] were (916) 
[44856] the (889)

[44859] of (977) 
[44860] his (623)

[44863] a (495) 
[44864] few (474)

[44866] I (573)

[44868] written (372) 
[44869] my (606)

[44871] paid (423) 
[44872] Whitney (221) 
[44873] s (906)

[45388] He (85) 
[45389] flicked (520) 
[45390] the (966) 
[45391] horse (709) 
[45392] with (948) 
[45393] his (432) 
[45394] whip, (358) 
[45395] and (991) 
[45396] we (960) 
[45397] dashed (852) 
[45398] away (949) 
[45399] through (719) 
[45400] the (512) 
[45401] endless (155) 
[45402] succession (77) 
[45403] of (794) 
[45404] sombre (101) 
[45405] and (764) 
[45406] deserted (448) 
[45407] streets, (524) 
[45408] which (776) 
[45409] widened (131) 
[45410] gradually, (714) 
[45411] until (925) 
[45412] we (48) 
[45413] were (882) 
[45414] flying (252) 
[45415] across (680) 
[45416] a (723) 
[45417] broad (824) 
[45418] balustraded (913) 
[45419] bridge, (181) 
[45420] with (182) 
[45421] the (441) 
[45422] murky (593) 
[45423] river (976) 
[45424] flowing (343) 
[45425] sluggishly (26) 
[45426] beneath (805) 
[45427] us (21) 
[45428] Beyond (111) 
[45429] lay (826) 
[45430] another (280) 
[45431] dull (6) 
[45432] wilderness (619) 
[45433] of (640) 
[45434] bricks (523) 
[45435] and (312) 
[45436] mortar, (707) 
[45437] its (711) 
[45438] silence (198) 
[45439] broken (792) 
[45440] only (629) 
[45441] by (791) 
[45442] the (498) 
[45443] heavy, (600) 
[45444] regular (793) 
[45445] footfall (850) 
[45446] of (495) 
[45447] the (20) 
[45448] policeman, (676) 
[45449] or (902) 
[45450] the (568) 
[45451] songs (138) 
[45452] and (873) 
[45453] shouts (199) 
[45454] of (309) 
[45455] some (322) 
[45456] belated (877) 
[45457] party (905) 
[45458] of (122) 
[45459] revellers (68) 
[45460] A (930) 
[45461] dull (174) 
[45462] wrack (609) 
[45463] was (553) 
[45464] drifting (42) 
[45465] slowly (817) 
[45466] across (34) 
[45467] the (39) 
[45468] sky, (341) 
[45469] and (194) 
[45470] a (729) 
[45471] star (388) 
[45472] or (402) 
[45473] two (601) 
[45474] twinkled (718) 
[45475] dimly (39) 
[45476] here (954) 
[45477] and (684) 
[45478] there (678) 
[45479] through (963) 
[45480] the (836) 
[45481] rifts (647) 
[45482] of (475) 
[45483] the (725) 
[45484] clouds (101) 
[45485] Holmes (959) 
[45486] drove (669) 
[45487] in (976) 
[45488] silence, (706) 
[45489] with (697) 
[45490] his (327) 
[45491] head (253) 
[45492] sunk (907) 
[45493] upon (681) 
[45494] his (259) 
[45495] breast, (237) 
[45496] and (850) 
[45497] the (782) 
[45498] air (146) 
[45499] of (516) 
[45500] a (630) 
[45501] man (655) 
[45502] who (660) 
[45503] is (896) 
[45504] lost (70) 
[45505] in (35) 
[45506] thought, (573) 
[45507] while (986) 
[45508] I (277) 
[45509] sat (893) 
[45510] beside (568) 
[45511] him, (845) 
[45512] curious (370) 
[45513] to (207) 
[45514] learn (486) 
[45515] what (654) 
[45516] this (773) 
[45517] new (695) 
[45518] quest (591) 
[45519] might (464) 
[45520] be (391) 
[45521] which (512) 
[45522] seemed (79) 
[45523] to (743) 
[45524] tax (690) 
[45525] his (187) 
[45526] powers (472) 
[45527] so (577) 
[45528] sorely, (830) 
[45529] and (599) 
[45530] yet (883) 
[45531] afraid (72) 
[45532] to (715) 
[45533] break (291) 
[45534] in (692) 
[45535] upon (718) 
[45536] the (293) 
[45537] current (289) 
[45538] of (437) 
[45539] his (651) 
[45540] thoughts (296) 
[45541] We (689) 
[45542] had (229) 
[45543] driven (361) 
[45544] several (643) 
[45545] miles, (508) 
[45546] and (931) 
[45547] were (615) 
[45548] beginning (472) 
[45549] to (236) 
[45550] get (737) 
[45551] to (975) 
[45552] the (636) 
[45553] fringe (722) 
[45554] of (917) 
[45555] the (816) 
[45556] belt (627) 
[45557] of (229) 
[45558] suburban (665) 
[45559] villas, (613) 
[45560] when (235) 
[45561] he (888) 
[45562] shook (917) 
[45563] himself, (558) 
[45564] shrugged (85) 
[45565] his (328) 
[45566] shoulders, (649) 
[45567] and (910) 
[45568] lit (756) 
[45569] up (451) 
[45570] his (797) 
[45571] pipe (535) 
[45572] with (988) 
[45573] the (636) 
[45574] air (134) 
[45575] of (978) 
[45576] a (634) 
[45577] man (705) 
[45578] who (102) 
[45579] has (84) 
[45580] satisfied (859) 
[45581] himself (506) 
[45582] that (667) 
[45583] he (873) 
[45584] is (92) 
[45585] acting (617) 
[45586] for (31) 
[45587] the (826) 
[45588] best (586) 
[45589] "You (372)

[45595] silence, (947) 
[45596] Watson," (724) 
[45597] said (223) 
[45598] he (707) 
[45599] "It (584)

[46169] seemed (161) 
[46170] to (431) 
[46171] her, (257)

[46185] she (707) 
[46186] distinctly (782) 
[46187] saw (223)

[46189] face, (418) 
[46190] which (525) 
[46191] she (609)

[46195] terribly (878) 
[46196] agitated (173)

[46198] waved (163) 
[46199] his (546)

[46201] frantically (378) 
[46202] to (976) 
[46203] her, (409) 
[46204] and (24) 
[46205] then (73) 
[46206] vanished (863) 
[46207] from (980) 
[46208] the (654) 
[46209] window (961) 
[46210] so (330) 
[46211] suddenly (165) 
[46212] that (445) 
[46213] it (62) 
[46214] seemed (612)

[46235] quick (967) 
[46236] feminine (976) 
[46237] eye (526)

[46441] of (869) 
[46442] hideous (920) 
[46443] aspect, (273) 
[46444] who, (819) 
[46445] it (767) 
[46446] seems, (761)

[46454] the (425) 
[46455] Lascar (612)

[46476] that (405) 
[46477] the (50) 
[46478] inspector (851) 
[46479] was (573) 
[46480] staggered, (956) 
[46481] and (882) 
[46482] had (973) 
[46483] almost (524) 
[46484] come (48) 
[46485] to (159) 
[46486] believe (768) 
[46487] that (718) 
[46488] Mrs (880) 
[46489] St (614) 
[46490] Clair (940) 
[46491] had (800) 
[46492] been (561) 
[46493] deluded (771) 
[46494] when, (736) 
[46495] with (497) 
[46496] a (460) 
[46497] cry, (153) 
[46498] she (410) 
[46499] sprang (282) 
[46500] at (925) 
[46501] a (898) 
[46502] small (563) 
[46503] deal (258)

[46510] and (574) 
[46511] tore (919) 
[46512] the (245) 
[46513] lid (602) 
[46514] from (823) 
[46515] it (637) 
[46516] Out (545) 
[46517] there (581) 
[46518] fell (475) 
[46519] a (728)

[46526] was (44) 
[46527] the (577)

[46529] which (858) 
[46530] he (846) 
[46531] had (553) 
[46532] promised (707) 
[46533] to (552) 
[46534] bring (472)

[46538] and (168) 
[46539] the (381) 
[46540] evident (251) 
[46541] confusion (525) 
[46542] which (977) 
[46543] the (86) 
[46544] cripple (509) 
[46545] showed, (788) 
[46546] made (859) 
[46547] the (167) 
[46548] inspector (648) 
[46549] realise (55) 
[46550] that (615) 
[46551] the (896)

[46978] you (272)

[47006] on (217) 
[47007] his (188)

[47010] as (692) 
[47011] he (872)

[47013] a (521) 
[47014] piteous (985)

[47035] have (761) 
[47036] watched (892) 
[47037] the (856) 
[47038] fellow (108)

[47041] once (160) 
[47042] before (972)

[47045] thought (785) 
[47046] of (692) 
[47047] making (249) 
[47048] his (15)

[47052] I (281)

[47055] surprised (379) 
[47056] at (964) 
[47057] the (278) 
[47058] harvest (67) 
[47059] which (970) 
[47060] he (488) 
[47061] has (770) 
[47062] reaped (967) 
[47063] in (509) 
[47064] a (755) 
[47065] short (771) 
[47066] time (841)

[47068] appearance, (210) 
[47069] you (884) 
[47070] see, (52) 
[47071] is (219) 
[47072] so (25) 
[47073] remarkable (868) 
[47074] that (742) 
[47075] no (222) 
[47076] one (120) 
[47077] can (869)

[47092] by (875) 
[47093] a (931) 
[47094] horrible (978) 
[47095] scar, (807) 
[47096] which, (670) 
[47097] by (823) 
[47098] its (808) 
[47099] contraction, (931) 
[47100] has (279)

[47104] outer (579) 
[47105] edge (437) 
[47106] of (723)

[47118] penetrating (582) 
[47119] dark (163) 
[47120] eyes, (505)

[47124] singular (880) 
[47125] contrast (992) 
[47126] to (738) 
[47127] the (534) 
[47128] colour (938) 
[47129] of (586)

[47134] him (932) 
[47135] out (572)

[47936] not (626) 
[47937] be (78) 
[47938] shown (577) 
[47939] that (327) 
[47940] there (804) 
[47941] had (368) 
[47942] ever (642)

[47949] had (909) 
[47950] for (931) 
[47951] years (541) 
[47952] been (340) 
[47953] known (55) 
[47954] as (576) 
[47955] a (412) 
[47956] professional (888) 
[47957] beggar, (727) 
[47958] but (928) 
[47959] his (768) 
[47960] life (121) 
[47961] appeared (798) 
[47962] to (274) 
[47963] have (855) 
[47964] been (55) 
[47965] a (254) 
[47966] very (142) 
[47967] quiet (278) 
[47968] and (936) 
[47969] innocent (430) 
[47970] one (962) 
[47971] There (661) 
[47972] the (974) 
[47973] matter (612) 
[47974] stands (314) 
[47975] at (472) 
[47976] present, (260) 
[47977] and (358) 
[47978] the (922) 
[47979] questions (946) 
[47980] which (162) 
[47981] have (188) 
[47982] to (633) 
[47983] be (246) 
[47984] solved (271) 
[47985] what (241) 
[47986] Neville (893) 
[47987] St (124) 
[47988] Clair (270) 
[47989] was (144)

[47992] the (908) 
[47993] opium (952) 
[47994] den, (577) 
[47995] what (518) 
[47996] happened (996) 
[47997] to (385) 
[47998] him (253)

[48006] what (860) 
[48007] Hugh (983) 
[48008] Boone (550) 
[48009] had (460) 
[48010] to (65)

[48021] solution (676) 
[48022] as (967) 
[48023] ever (262) 
[48024] I (13) 
[48025] confess (221) 
[48026] that (121) 
[48027] I (69) 
[48028] cannot (808) 
[48029] recall (200) 
[48030] any (352) 
[48031] case (287) 
[48032] within (825) 
[48033] my (35) 
[48034] experience (170) 
[48035] which (116) 
[48036] looked (859) 
[48037] at (851) 
[48038] the (73) 
[48039] first (65) 
[48040] glance (958) 
[48041] so (758) 
[48042] simple (34) 
[48043] and (226) 
[48044] yet (913) 
[48045] which (225) 
[48046] presented (106) 
[48047] such (503) 
[48048] difficulties (48) 
[48049] " (719) 
[48050] While (592) 
[48051] Sherlock (756) 
[48052] Holmes (529) 
[48053] had (899) 
[48054] been (832) 
[48055] detailing (369) 
[48056] this (301) 
[48057] singular (387) 
[48058] series (510) 
[48059] of (871) 
[48060] events, (293) 
[48061] we (211) 
[48062] had (304) 
[48063] been (896) 
[48064] whirling (130) 
[48065] through (545) 
[48066] the (351) 
[48067] outskirts (248) 
[48068] of (494) 
[48069] the (349) 
[48070] great (305) 
[48071] town (59) 
[48072] until (971) 
[48073] the (287) 
[48074] last (980) 
[48075] straggling (764) 
[48076] houses (954) 
[48077] had (498) 
[48078] been (457) 
[48079] left (357) 
[48080] behind, (653) 
[48081] and (16) 
[48082] we (23) 
[48083] rattled (391) 
[48084] along (400) 
[48085] with (138) 
[48086] a (573) 
[48087] country (689) 
[48088] hedge (479) 
[48089] upon (349) 
[48090] either (843) 
[48091] side (460) 
[48092] of (210) 
[48093] us (216) 
[48094] Just (968) 
[48095] as (672) 
[48096] he (240) 
[48097] finished, (616) 
[48098] however, (410) 
[48099] we (986) 
[48100] drove (410) 
[48101] through (155) 
[48102] two (24) 
[48103] scattered (274) 
[48104] villages, (297) 
[48105] where (774) 
[48106] a (900) 
[48107] few (803) 
[48108] lights (80) 
[48109] still (704) 
[48110] glimmered (359) 
[48111] in (381) 
[48112] the (933) 
[48113] windows (310) 
[48114] "We (931)

[48121] said (518) 
[48122] my (406) 
[48123] companion (117) 
[48124] "We (828)

[48258] We (342) 
[48259] had (60) 
[48260] pulled (227) 
[48261] up (188) 
[48262] in (462)

[48285] and (638) 
[48286] springing (394) 
[48287] down, (611) 
[48288] I (690) 
[48289] followed (681) 
[48290] Holmes (340) 
[48291] up (479) 
[48292] the (392)

[48324] mousseline (858)

[48360] eagerness, (931) 
[48361] her (245) 
[48362] body (942) 
[48363] slightly (104) 
[48364] bent, (330) 
[48365] her (351) 
[48366] head (976) 
[48367] and (940) 
[48368] face (104) 
[48369] protruded, (754) 
[48370] with (650) 
[48371] eager (742) 
[48372] eyes (91) 
[48373] and (825) 
[48374] parted (954) 
[48375] lips, (946) 
[48376] a (265) 
[48377] standing (266) 
[48378] question (750) 
[48379] "Well?" (814) 
[48380] she (922) 
[48381] cried, (496) 
[48382] "well?" (183) 
[48383] And (511) 
[48384] then, (188) 
[48385] seeing (39) 
[48386] that (948) 
[48387] there (898) 
[48388] were (781) 
[48389] two (363) 
[48390] of (355) 
[48391] us, (33) 
[48392] she (922) 
[48393] gave (637) 
[48394] a (151) 
[48395] cry (648) 
[48396] of (245) 
[48397] hope (848) 
[48398] which (442) 
[48399] sank (143) 
[48400] into (906) 
[48401] a (507) 
[48402] groan (129) 
[48403] as (552) 
[48404] she (827) 
[48405] saw (899) 
[48406] that (736) 
[48407] my (690) 
[48408] companion (590) 
[48409] shook (683) 
[48410] his (59) 
[48411] head (103) 
[48412] and (611) 
[48413] shrugged (479) 
[48414] his (50) 
[48415] shoulders (541) 
[48416] "No (484)

[48685] down (120) 
[48686] at (788) 
[48687] him (715)

[49814] sitting (467) 
[49815] there, (435)

[49821] his (804) 
[49822] lips, (551) 
[49823] his (306) 
[49824] eyes (944) 
[49825] fixed (918) 
[49826] vacantly (217) 
[49827] upon (76) 
[49828] the (97) 
[49829] corner (183)

[49832] ceiling, (378) 
[49833] the (176) 
[49834] blue (62) 
[49835] smoke (715) 
[49836] curling (156) 
[49837] up (840) 
[49838] from (856) 
[49839] him, (194) 
[49840] silent, (651) 
[49841] motionless, (549) 
[49842] with (698) 
[49843] the (829) 
[49844] light (667) 
[49845] shining (194) 
[49846] upon (749) 
[49847] his (737) 
[49848] strong (715) 
[49849] set (71) 
[49850] aquiline (509) 
[49851] features (414) 
[49852] So (237) 
[49853] he (192) 
[49854] sat (12) 
[49855] as (85) 
[49856] I (210) 
[49857] dropped (914) 
[49858] off (23) 
[49859] to (929) 
[49860] sleep, (808) 
[49861] and (349) 
[49862] so (159) 
[49863] he (869) 
[49864] sat (325) 
[49865] when (392) 
[49866] a (562) 
[49867] sudden (402) 
[49868] ejaculation (486) 
[49869] caused (18) 
[49870] me (873) 
[49871] to (542) 
[49872] wake (415) 
[49873] up, (60) 
[49874] and (770) 
[49875] I (363) 
[49876] found (845) 
[49877] the (952) 
[49878] summer (293) 
[49879] sun (33) 
[49880] shining (204) 
[49881] into (883) 
[49882] the (425) 
[49883] apartment (398) 
[49884] The (680) 
[49885] pipe (179) 
[49886] was (515) 
[49887] still (777) 
[49888] between (150) 
[49889] his (436) 
[49890] lips, (556) 
[49891] the (338) 
[49892] smoke (150) 
[49893] still (229) 
[49894] curled (522) 
[49895] upward, (304) 
[49896] and (947) 
[49897] the (216) 
[49898] room (945) 
[49899] was (127) 
[49900] full (942) 
[49901] of (432) 
[49902] a (896) 
[49903] dense (395) 
[49904] tobacco (773) 
[49905] haze, (375) 
[49906] but (261) 
[49907] nothing (43) 
[49908] remained (690) 
[49909] of (404) 
[49910] the (574) 
[49911] heap (11) 
[49912] of (484) 
[49913] shag (132) 
[49914] which (521) 
[49915] I (677) 
[49916] had (700) 
[49917] seen (965) 
[49918] upon (210) 
[49919] the (648) 
[49920] previous (863) 
[49921] night (712) 
[49922] "Awake, (780) 
[49923] Watson?" (577) 
[49924] he (275) 
[49925] asked (671) 
[49926] "Yes (48)

[49928] "Game (945)

[49933] "Certainly (922)

[49961] to (893)
